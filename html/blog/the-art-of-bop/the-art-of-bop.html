				<p>
					Now that I’ve <a href="../advanced-techniques/advanced-techniques.html">written about</a>
					<i>Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer</i>, I don’t want to wait too long before writing
					about its unofficial companion piece, <i>The Art of Bop Drumming</i> by John Riley. As previously
					mentioned, both books are go–to answers for the question “how do I learn jazz drumming”. But as I
					wrote a few months ago, I think Advanced Techniques is a poor introduction to the style and has few
					musical applications overall. Is <i>The Art of Bop</i> any better?
				</p>

				<p>
					Well… yes it is. In fact, I don’t think it’s even close. First published in 1994, <i>The Art of
						Bop</i> seems to have caused quite a splash when it came out, probably because there was nothing
					quite like it at the time (and there really still isn’t). <i>The Art of Bop</i> isn’t quite a method
					book; rather, it’s almost a sort of jazz study guide. In addition to notated exercises, there are
					lengthy sections of the book written in prose and featuring detailed discussions of a variety of
					topics.
				</p>

				<p>
					The star of the book is probably the comping patterns that take up about 15 of the 80 total pages.
					These start off pretty simple, with exercises written just for the snare. The bass drum eventually
					gets added in, and the last page of the comping section is quite challenging. There is a good
					difficulty curve to these exercises, although the final patterns are a bit limited in their
					practicality — they are busy and dense, limiting the situations in which they would sound musical,
					or would even be playable.
				</p>

				<p>
					The presentation of these exercises is a little strange, as the comping part of the book uses
					two–bar patterns. I think it would have been better to use one bar exercises, or perhaps do what
					<i>Syncopation</i> does where the same measure is repeated four times to fill up and system of
					music. If the intention was to get a drummer to think about melodic, dynamic comping patterns, the
					solution here is to use summary pages (à la <i>Syncopation</i>), where the different comping
					patterns are strung together to create an etude of sorts. You could do this yourself, but some
					two–measure exercises don’t work well when you try to play them one after another (you’ll
					occasionally run into quadruple strokes on the kick or snare).
				</p>

				<p>
					It’s worth noting that, unlike <i>Advanced Techniques</i>, the ride cymbal pattern is not written in
					for these exercises. I think this creates an unnecessary learning curve to starting these exercises.
					I can understand why the ride cymbal isn’t there, as learning how to apply/orchestrate rhythms in
					isolation is a very important part of swing drumming. But I still think the ride should be there. It
					can be tough to realize you’re playing things wrong unless you go through the book with a teacher.
				</p>

				<p>
					To be clear though, even the most torturous comping motifs are still much more applicable than most
					of <i>Advanced Techniques</i>, and more importantly, <i>The Art of Bop</i> doesn’t go overboard with
					it. This is why I think <i>The Art of Bop</i> is a much better book, as much of it just has more
					useful licks than the needlessly difficult independence patterns of <i>Advanced Techniques</i>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another reason why people tend to think <i>The Art of Bop</i> is the better book comes from the
					sections that discuss the many facets of jazz drumming. But for me, these are a little hit or miss.
				</p>
				<p>
					For instance, there isn’t a great discourse on what “swing” means. In <i>The Art of Bop</i>, Riley
					takes the “swing = triplets” approach, but the truth is that you can create a swing feel with a
					variety of subdivisions. I guess Riley wanted to keep things simple — since most drummers use
					triplets to create a swing feel, Riley probably thought it would be best to cut to the chase.
				</p>

				<p>
					But Riley likes to get abstract and philosophical, and I think that mindset is better applied to a
					discussion of what swing is rather than some of the other topics Riley opines on. For example,
					there’s a tuning section that’s lacking in specifics and is not especially informative. There’s a
					pretty good discussion of bass drum feathering, but it gets bogged down with some over–detailed
					explanations of the heel–toe technique. The comping section has brief passages discussing pacing and
					“Rhythmic Transposition”, but these are hard to make sense of without some real musical
					accompaniment. I guess just being aware of these ideas is the important takeaway.
				</p>

				<p>
					Aside from the famous comping section, the next big chunk that involves extensive drumming exercises
					is the solo section. I’m always a little wary of written–out drum solos. They can be fun reading
					challenges, but it’s hard to develop a drum solo method, since memorizing 32 bar solos seems to have
					diminishing results.
				</p>

				<p>
					Thankfully, Riley keeps things simple with what are essentially one–measure fills, which are usable
					enough, although there are far too many straight 16th notes for my taste. More interestingly,
					there’s an extensive demonstration of how to take one fill and modify it by way of orchestrations,
					removing notes, going into double–time/half–time, and using 3 beat fills in 4/4 (essentially
					polymeter).
				</p>

				<p>
					There are some longer written–out solos, but they come across as elementary and mechanical. They
					don’t sound like anything you’d hear on a jazz record, or any record really. Meanwhile, there’s a
					brushes section, which is ok — it could be a little clearer, but writing books about brush playing
					can be notoriously challenging. There’s also a bit of lip service to other styles like Sambas and
					Mambos.
				</p>

				<p>
					The final big chunk of practice materials comes from lead sheet playalongs. There are six original
					tunes included and while they aren’t as exciting as something like a big band chart, they are still
					quite valuable.
				</p>

				<p>
					So all in all, there’s a ton of content in <i>The Art of Bop</i>. Some of it might get a bit too
					theoretical, but ultimately Riley seems to know that listening is the best way to understand the
					genre, and the finale of the book is a lengthy recommended listening section.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ultimately, whenever I revisit <i>The Art of Bop</i>, I find myself going back to the comping
					section more than anything else. I’m not sure what kind of endorsement that is — it seems clear that
					most of the book is “one and done” if you follow. Nonetheless, the comping section alone is worth
					the price of admission.

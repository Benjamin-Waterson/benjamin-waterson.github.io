		<h1>Transcription: “Time Check” — Gregg Bisonette with The Buddy Rich Big Band</h1>
		<div class="full-row">

		<p>
			This is part 2 of my posts concerning the 1989 Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship concert. Today, we’re looking at Gregg Bisonette’s playing from “Time Check”. Gregg did a fantastic job that night; <a href="https://youtu.be/_loihfsCg6Y" target="_blank">his playing on “In A Mellow Tone”</a> swings harder than almost anything else from the show, and he goes very hard on this chart:

		<p>
			This was the actually the first thing I tackled from the concert. It all started with this lick starting around the 5:00 mark, a cool linear hi hat joint featuring the left foot pedal. Gregg plays it as 16th notes before playing the same pattern as 16th note triplets. It’s a lot of fun to play:
		</p>

			<br>
		<p>
			Once I got that worked out, I took a look at some of Gregg’s other playing. I’ve worked out some of the more exciting moments of the chart, such as the build up before the tenor solo. A favorite moment of mine that happens at the climax of the tenor solo, at the 2:40 mark. The whole band is going 100 miles an hour, and I’ve worked that out as well. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I’ve also featured the shout chorus finale, including the solo leading into this section: 
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			In this solo is a flam lick that confounded me for some time — you can hear Gregg play it all throughout the tune. I suspected it was a favorite chop of his, but since this was my only exposure to Gregg at the time I struggled to get it worked out. That is until, by chance, Gregg posted <a href="https://youtu.be/3nxFhSH9LDM" target="_blank">a video with Drumeo back in December</a> of last year explaining it. It’s essentially the blushda, which is a flam drag rhythm played with shuffle sticking, usually rLRL. Often, a shuffle accent pattern is also thrown in:
		</p>

		<img src="../../../images/blog/time-check/time-check-blushda-example.png" class="centered-image" alt="Blusha">
		<br>

		<p>
			A related concept includes the <a href="../../../images/blog/time-check/time-check-swiss-drag-example.png" target="_blank">Swiss drag</a>, a flam drag rhythm played with Swiss army triplet sticking. Although most of these “hybrids” come out of drum corps, the blushda seems to be a drum set lick these days. I feel that Swiss drags and standard flam drags are much more common in the drumline world, while the blushda is one of the few hybrids a typical drum set player is likely to know about. In fact, drum set players all over the internet became obsessed with the blushda about 5 years ago.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most of the blushda licks in the solo are played with a left hand lead; that is, a right hand grace note. Also, the drags are often played somewhere in between a proper 32nd note double and a buzzed stroke. Listen closely to the recording to hear what I’m taking about.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, be aware that Gregg does a lot of left hand comping when he's playing with the band. I tried to notate it best I could, but I didn't write anything down I couldn't clearly see on the video.
		</p>

		<p>
			After the shout chorus, Gregg starts an extended solo. Gregg kicks off the solo with steady quarter notes on the feet while ad-libbing some fills on top. This section includes a 5 over 2 polyrhythm, which is much easier to play than you think. Quick aside, you should be comfortable being able to play almost any subdivision over a quarter note pulse, at reasonable tempos.
		</p>

		<p>
			The main transcription starts back up when Gregg moves into a latin groove, grounded with a tresillo-style rhythm. A bit unusual for a swing tune, but it’s a grooving section nonetheless. We could have arguments all day over whether or not it fits, but I don’t really care because I think it sounds great. It doesn’t look like much on paper, but once you play the groove you’ll realize how busy it is. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Gregg starts to break out the double kick after the hi hat pedal lick, including this cool nested triplet thing (the time’s a little loosey goosey). I find a lot of Gregg’s double bass licks to be very tasteful and hip, and much of his playing makes up what standard double bass vocabulary is in the 21st century. 
		</p>

		<p>
			A very, very demanding paradiddle-diddle passage gives us the first big climax of the solo. The actual diddles are a bit crushed, and sound closer to buzzes with how fast they are played. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This was another segment that confounded me; I ending up tracking down a video Gregg made around 1992 called <i>Private Lesson</i> (a creative name I know). I gave it a watch, and lucky for me Gregg explicitly breaks this lick down as paradiddle-diddles.
		</p>

		<p>
			I originally called it a day after this section, but I wanted to take a quick look at some of the brush playing that comes next. Gregg has some pretty typical swing moves, with a lot of feel, but notice what he does with sixteenth notes — he seems to be a fan of playing extended strokes on the right hand and throwing in short, left hand sweeps. I did my best to notate them with staccato dots, but ultimately I had to include the sicking: 
		</p>

		<img src="../../../images/blog/time-check/time-check-brushes.png" class="centered-image" alt="Brushes">
		<br>

		<p>
			He also dishes out some rather intricate linear moves:
		</p>

		<img src="../../../images/blog/time-check/time-check-brushes-linear.png" class="centered-image" alt="Linear Brushes">
		<br>

		<p>
			I decided to finally call it a day after that. With regards to what comes next, Gregg really shows off the double kick chops with some blast beats starting at 7:04. If there’s any part of the solo I find jarring, it’s this moment. I suspect Gregg was trying to show off his double bass skills; he definitely had the best double kick abilities of anyone there that night, but it does come out of nowhere. I think it has more to do with hitting a solid 2 and 4 rather than shredding on the kick (the whole chart doesn’t really call for strong rimshot backbeats at all, let alone a rock-style 2 and 4).
		</p>

		<p>
			I skimped out on notating the final part of the solo because I’m not terribly interested in double kick playing overall, since I don’t double bass. At the bottom of this list is the blast beat. There’s nothing terribly complicated going on for the finale. 
		</p>

		<p>
			FYI, the caesura mark shows up for very subtle pauses in time, too subtle to be notated rhythmically without making use of an obnoxious /32 or /64 time signature, which I don’t think would be helpful. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Gregg seems to be working with some solo concepts he was developing specifically in the late 80’s early 90’s. There’s an excerpt on YouTube from the beginning of <i>Private Lesson</i>: a 14 minute solo where Gregg uses a lot of the same ideas from the Memorial Concert solo:

		</div>

		<p>
			(I apologize for the fidelity of the video — it’s only from 2010 but it looks like a potato VHS rip and I couldn’t find another version. Win some lose some I guess. I can’t help but laugh at the description: “Best available quality”. Give me a break.)
		</p>

		<p>
			One last thing: the chart is a fast 4 (played as half note = 144), but I have the solo section notated in what would be half time. I could have done the whole thing in double time, but that would have been dreadful to transcribe and even worse to read. Plus, I don’t think that’s how Gregg counted it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Gregg's appearance that night is pretty interesting. I think out of all the drummers who were there, Gregg was probably the most mainstream, recording touring around wth David Lee Roth and all that (check out <a href="https://youtu.be/1iEtdSp8cUA" target="_blank">a hiliarious video</a> of Gregg explaining how he joined DLR). I have a feeling that many dismiss Gregg and pigeonhole him as a flashy glam rock drummer, but he definitely knows his way around many styles. Gregg studied jazz and played with guys like Maynard Ferguson, so I say embrace the hair and his ridiculous Pearl double kick setup.

			<i>*Gregg bundled this video with another one of his,</i> Playing, Reading, and Soling with a Band, <i>into <a href="https://www.alfred.com/gregg-bissonette-yesterday-today-tomorrow/p/93-DV10022001/" target="_blank">a new video called</a></i> Gregg Bisonette: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow <i>that features some new material he shot in 2012. It’s much cheaper than either of the videos individually, although it does not have the play-along books included. You’ll have to get those separately.</i>

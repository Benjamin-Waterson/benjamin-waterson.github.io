				<p>
					This is part 2 of my posts concerning the 1989 Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship concert. Today, we’re
					looking at Gregg Bisonette’s playing from “Time Check”. Gregg did a fantastic job that night; <a
						href="https://youtu.be/_loihfsCg6Y" target="_blank">his playing on “In A Mellow Tone”</a> swings
					harder than almost anything else from the show, and he goes very hard on this chart:
				</p>

						allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>

				<p>
					This was the actually the first thing I tackled from the concert. It all started with this lick
					starting around the 5:00 mark, a cool linear hi hat joint featuring the left foot pedal. Gregg plays
					it as 16th notes before playing the same pattern as 16th note triplets. It’s a lot of fun to play:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/time-check/time-check-hi-hat-lick.png" class="centered-image"
					alt="Hi Hat Lick">

				<p>
					Once I got that worked out, I took a look at some of Gregg’s other playing. I’ve worked out some of
					the more exciting moments of the chart, such as the build up before the tenor solo. A favorite
					moment of mine that happens at the climax of the tenor solo, at the 2:40 mark. The whole band is
					going 100 miles an hour, and I’ve worked that out as well.
				</p>

				<p>
					I’ve also featured the shout chorus finale, including the solo leading into this section:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/time-check/time-check-soli-solo.png" class="centered-image"
					alt="Soli Solo">


				<p>
					In this solo is a flam lick that confounded me for some time — you can hear Gregg play it all
					throughout the tune. I suspected it was a favorite chop of his, but since this was my only exposure
					to Gregg at the time I struggled to get it worked out. That is until, by chance, Gregg posted <a
						href="https://youtu.be/3nxFhSH9LDM" target="_blank">a video with Drumeo back in December</a> of
					last year explaining it. It’s essentially the blushda, which is a flam drag rhythm played with
					shuffle sticking, usually rLRL. Often, a shuffle accent pattern is also thrown in:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/time-check/time-check-blushda-example.png" class="centered-image"
					alt="Blusha">

				<p>
					A related concept includes the <a
						href="../../../images/blog/time-check/time-check-swiss-drag-example.png" target="_blank">Swiss
						drag</a>, a flam drag rhythm played with Swiss army triplet sticking. Although most of these
					“hybrids” come out of drum corps, the blushda seems to be a drum set lick these days. I feel that
					Swiss drags and standard flam drags are much more common in the drumline world, while the blushda is
					one of the few hybrids a typical drum set player is likely to know about. In fact, drum set players
					all over the internet became obsessed with the blushda about 5 years ago.
				</p>

				<p>
					Most of the blushda licks in the solo are played with a left hand lead; that is, a right hand grace
					note. Also, the drags are often played somewhere in between a proper 32nd note double and a buzzed
					stroke. Listen closely to the recording to hear what I’m taking about.
				</p>

				<p>
					Also, be aware that Gregg does a lot of left hand comping when he's playing with the band. I tried
					to notate it best I could, but I didn't write anything down I couldn't clearly see on the video.
				</p>

				<p>
					After the shout chorus, Gregg starts an extended solo. Gregg kicks off the solo with steady quarter
					notes on the feet while ad-libbing some fills on top. This section includes a 5 over 2 polyrhythm,
					which is much easier to play than you think. Quick aside, you should be comfortable being able to
					play almost any subdivision over a quarter note pulse, at reasonable tempos.
				</p>

				<p>
					The main transcription starts back up when Gregg moves into a latin groove, grounded with a
					tresillo-style rhythm. A bit unusual for a swing tune, but it’s a grooving section nonetheless. We
					could have arguments all day over whether or not it fits, but I don’t really care because I think it
					sounds great. It doesn’t look like much on paper, but once you play the groove you’ll realize how
					busy it is.
				</p>

				<p>
					Gregg starts to break out the double kick after the hi hat pedal lick, including this cool nested
					triplet thing (the time’s a little loosey goosey). I find a lot of Gregg’s double bass licks to be
					very tasteful and hip, and much of his playing makes up what standard double bass vocabulary is in
					the 21st century.
				</p>

				<p>
					A very, very demanding paradiddle-diddle passage gives us the first big climax of the solo. The
					actual diddles are a bit crushed, and sound closer to buzzes with how fast they are played.
				</p>

				<p>
					This was another segment that confounded me; I ending up tracking down a video Gregg made around
					1992 called <i>Private Lesson</i> (a creative name I know). I gave it a watch, and lucky for me
					Gregg explicitly breaks this lick down as paradiddle-diddles.
				</p>

				<p>
					I originally called it a day after this section, but I wanted to take a quick look at some of the
					brush playing that comes next. Gregg has some pretty typical swing moves, with a lot of feel, but
					notice what he does with sixteenth notes — he seems to be a fan of playing extended strokes on the
					right hand and throwing in short, left hand sweeps. I did my best to notate them with staccato dots,
					but ultimately I had to include the sicking:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/time-check/time-check-brushes.png" class="centered-image" alt="Brushes">

				<p>
					He also dishes out some rather intricate linear moves:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/time-check/time-check-brushes-linear.png" class="centered-image"
					alt="Linear Brushes">

				<p>
					I decided to finally call it a day after that. With regards to what comes next, Gregg really shows
					off the double kick chops with some blast beats starting at 7:04. If there’s any part of the solo I
					find jarring, it’s this moment. I suspect Gregg was trying to show off his double bass skills; he
					definitely had the best double kick abilities of anyone there that night, but it does come out of
					nowhere. I think it has more to do with hitting a solid 2 and 4 rather than shredding on the kick
					(the whole chart doesn’t really call for strong rimshot backbeats at all, let alone a rock-style 2
					and 4).
				</p>

				<p>
					I skimped out on notating the final part of the solo because I’m not terribly interested in double
					kick playing overall, since I don’t double bass. At the bottom of this list is the blast beat.
					There’s nothing terribly complicated going on for the finale.
				</p>

				<p>
					FYI, the caesura mark shows up for very subtle pauses in time, too subtle to be notated rhythmically
					without making use of an obnoxious /32 or /64 time signature, which I don’t think would be helpful.
				</p>

				<p>
					Gregg seems to be working with some solo concepts he was developing specifically in the late 80’s
					early 90’s. There’s an excerpt on YouTube from the beginning of <i>Private Lesson</i>: a 14 minute
					solo where Gregg uses a lot of the same ideas from the Memorial Concert solo:
				</p>

				</div>

				<p>
					(I apologize for the fidelity of the video — it’s only from 2010 but it looks like a potato VHS rip
					and I couldn’t find another version. Win some lose some I guess. I can’t help but laugh at the
					description: “Best available quality”. Give me a break.)
				</p>

				<p>
					One last thing: the chart is a fast 4 (played as half note = 144), but I have the solo section
					notated in what would be half time. I could have done the whole thing in double time, but that would
					have been dreadful to transcribe and even worse to read. Plus, I don’t think that’s how Gregg
					counted it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Gregg's appearance that night is pretty interesting. I think out of all the drummers who were there,
					Gregg was probably the most mainstream, recording touring around wth David Lee Roth and all that
					(check out <a href="https://youtu.be/1iEtdSp8cUA" target="_blank">a hiliarious video</a> of Gregg
					explaining how he joined DLR). I have a feeling that many dismiss Gregg and pigeonhole him as a
					flashy glam rock drummer, but he definitely knows his way around many styles. Gregg studied jazz and
					played with guys like Maynard Ferguson, so I say embrace the hair and his ridiculous Pearl double
					kick setup.
				</p>

					<i>*Gregg bundled this video with another one of his,</i> Playing, Reading, and Soling with a Band,
					<i>into <a href="https://www.alfred.com/gregg-bissonette-yesterday-today-tomorrow/p/93-DV10022001/"
							target="_blank">a new video called</a></i> Gregg Bisonette: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow
					<i>that features some new material he shot in 2012. It’s much cheaper than either of the videos
						individually, although it does not have the play-along books included. You’ll have to get those
						separately.</i>

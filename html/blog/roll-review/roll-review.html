		<h1>Review: <i>Roll Review</i> by Michael Skinner</h1>

		<p>(Review: <i>Roll Review</i>… try saying that five times fast!)</p>

		<p>It seems like a lot of musicians have <a href="http://www.cruiseshipdrummer.com/2022/04/get-it-while-you-can-different-drummers.html" target="_blank">gotten hip</a> to the resources afforded by these weird PDF libraries that have popped up across the internet (sites like Scribd, KUPDF, PDFCookie, and PDFCoffee). I don’t know why these sites exist, and I really don’t know why anyone would take the time to scan sheet music and upload it anonymously where it may or may not be seen. Nonetheless, there’s a lot of really interesting stuff out there.</p>

		<p>For most mainstream books, I always encourage that you eventually buy a physical copy if you bootleg a PDF. What’s more interesting to me are the books that are out of print. I’ll say it again: why anyone would take the time to scan one of these is beyond me, but I’m grateful since you can go down a rabbit hole on these sites and discover a gem like<i> Roll Review</i>.</p>

		<p>Roll Review was written by Micheal Skinner, a percussionist based out of the UK who can boast performance credits such as the London Philharmonic Orchestra. If it weren’t for <a href="https://www.percworks.co.uk/michaelskinner" target="_blank">this interview</a>, I wouldn’t know anything about the guy. He doesn’t seem to have a website or any contact info, so unfortunately I can’t reach out to him and ask about the status of this book.</p>

		<p>As far as I can tell, physicals copies of this<i> Roll Review</i> are not available anywhere. It’s a shame because this book is great.</p>

		<p>A while back I said I would review books in the order I went through them, but I’m gonna shake that up today because this is a pretty unique book that I just have to talk about.</p>

		<p>Unsurprisingly,<i> Roll Review</i> is all about the double stroke roll. However, instead of short roll exercises,<i> Roll Review</i> features patterns of singles and doubles, many of which are in odd meters:</p>

		<img src="../../../images/blog/roll-review/roll-review-excerpt.jpeg" class="centered-image" alt="Excerpt">

		<p>You can probably see the appeal; aside from the reading and counting challenge, consider how you can take one of the drills from the book (as written) and convert it to the appropriate tuplet:</p>

		<img src="../../../images/blog/roll-review/roll-review-application.png" class="centered-image" alt="Cowbell">

		<p>Aside from triplets, tuplet–based rolls are an avenue that not many drum kit players explore. But this can really give a fun edge to your playing, and<i> Roll Review</i> is full of stuff like it.</p>

		<p>Aside from the clear musical applications, these patterns are great reading challenges as well, and each chunk of exercises is followed up by a short solo, typically 8–16 bars in length. Even “straightforward” meters like 3/2 can be a fun brain–twister.</p>

		<p>The book is challenging, but not heinously so. Even after going through it, breaking out<i> Roll Review</i> to warm up can be very valuable, more so than many other books.</p>

		<p>I’m not sure if this is OK or not, but I’m going to link a PDF to this book. Please reach out to me if this is not acceptable, but there doesn’t seem to be an easy way to get ahold of this book legitimately.</p>

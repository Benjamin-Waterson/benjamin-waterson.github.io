					id="summary-image">
				<p>Sometimes I wonder if Tommy has ever read my “Jazz Crimes” post. There’s a very good chance he has —
					my article is one of the first things that shows up in Google if you punch in “tommy igoe jazz
					crimes”.</p>

				<p>It’s a bit of an exciting thought… well, more of a nerve–racking one if he’s read the first version
					of that post. Tommy, if you’ve read that and are now reading this, I really should apologize. The
					original write–up was some of the most turgid and scatterbrained writing I’ve ever produced. I
					feel sorry for anyone who read that.</p>

				<p>I guess I’ll give myself a shot at redemption by writing about Tommy again, this time disregarding
					any internet drama bullshit that I can’t be bothered with. Since <a
						href="../youtube-videos/youtube-videos.html" target="_blank">the last post</a> before my coding
					hiatus had me talking about why so many YouTube drumming videos are garbage, let’s talk about the
					last great drumming DVD ever made: <i>Great Hands for a Lifetime</i>.</p>

				<p><i>Great Hands for a Lifetime</i> is a rather monstrous four–hour video produced by Tommy and
					released in
					early 2010 (I think). The crux of the DVD is the namesake “Lifetime Warmup”, a warmup regime that
					also works to provide a sort of benchmark for the technical ability of your hands (or, as Tommy puts
					it, “an amazing routine that will do great things for your hands and give you a fresh awareness of
					your own technical facility and limitation”).</p>

						allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
						allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

				<p>The warmup essentially uses a double stroke roll to connect different licks together, mainly
					rudiments (as well as what I call “non–rudiments”: licks that aren’t on the list of 40 but aren’t
					often regarded as hybrids either).</p>

				<p>Half of the video concerns the warm–up, breaking down each part and teaching you how to string it all
					together, while the other half features Tommy instructing you on the fundamentals of drumming:
					proper grip and technique, as well as how to play the basic motions of drumming. The double stroke
					roll in particular gets an extended demonstration.</p>

						allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
						allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

				<p><i>Great Hands</i> works toward an interesting audience; I would not call it a day–one drum lesson.
					There’s
					an expectation that going into the video, you already know how to read music, and are knowledgeable
					in the basics of rhythm (time signatures, different subdivisions, and tempo changes, not to mention
					dynamics). As such, I think <i>Great Hands</i> might be too much for someone who has never picked up
					a pair
					of sticks before.</p>

				<p>Rather, I look at the DVD as a gut check for the type of player who’s been messing around on the
					kit for a year or two but hasn’t spent quality time with an instructor. Or, as in my case, a gut
					check for the kind of player who’s far removed from their time with a teacher.</p>

				<p>When I first went through <i>Great Hands</i>, I had been playing for about 15 years, but I was
					curious about
					the content of the project since it’s a highly regarded DVD (and one of the last ever produced). And
					I did enjoy going through it; it was effective at putting me through my paces, and there is a lot of
					practice material in the video. I still watch snippets from time to time — it’s very helpful for
					getting back into the swing of things after I’ve taken a week or two off from playing/practicing.
					And the Lifetime Warmup is good fun to play, although it’s tough for me to go through the full
					version cold turkey without any preparation (and there’s a brutal five–minute version that I can’t
					imagine is an effective warmup for anyone who’s not gigging every night).</p>

				<p>The video does have a bit of philosophizing that leaves me kinda uneasy. In his opening spiel, Tommy
					encourages you to keep an open mind toward different approaches, methods, and techniques regarding
					music, while cautioning against getting too caught up in the “right” way to play (scare quotes his).
				</p>

				<p>A somewhat esoteric example is used of this Afro–Cuban/Latin thing Tommy heard about once where the
					fingers scratch the head of a snare drum. Maybe a more accessible idea would be the classic heel
					up/heel down discussion, or perhaps what exact grip to use. I can think of an infamous video that
					features a windbag drummer declaring French grip to be useless while also calling it German grip. I
					guess not researching basic things (while also having zero perspective) will get you onto YouTube’s
					most popular drumming platform.</p>

				<p>Despite the importance of keeping an open mind, Tommy also routinely makes it clear that there is
					indeed a right and a wrong way to play the drums. In fact, about two minutes after his opening
					monologue, you’ll hear Tommy say “this is wrong” for the first of many times during his demos.</p>

				<p>I can understand if the advice seems a little contradictory. I think I’ve come
					to the right conclusion, which is that I shouldn’t be too prejudiced while also having some
					discernment in what I take seriously as a drummer. It’s downright ignorant to bash on the French
					grip, but you must also accept that there are ways to play drums that will make your life needlessly
					difficult and should be avoided.</p>

				<p>Since I’ve (probably) taken away the right information, maybe this isn’t too much of an issue, but
					Tommy could have been a little clearer. I have a bit of a bigger problem with Tommy’s attitude
					toward the Rudiments. He’s very receptive to them, discouraging drummers from regarding the
					rudiments as being old–fashioned and marching–oriented.</p>

				<p>The problem is that the rudiments are, by their very nature, both old–fashioned and
					marching–oriented. Many of the rudiments (especially the ones talked about in the DVD) were
					developed by marching snare drummers decades, maybe even 100 years before the modern drum set came
					together.</p>

				<p>Tommy does make it clear that the video is not a rudiment method since he doesn’t talk about every
					rudiment nor what to do with them on the drum set. It just seems like he’s a bit overeager towards
					their embrace as if a lick is given objective importance to the drum set player just because it’s a
					rudiment. Ok, maybe I’m extrapolating here... but the reality is that, as much as we all love the paradiddle, many drummers forget about the 20 other rudiments no one ever uses since <a href="../drum-rudiments/drum-rudiments.html" target="_blank">they’re trash</a>.
				</p>

				<p>To me, the proof is in the pudding: Tommy doesn’t talk about every
					rudiment because not every
					rudiment is worth talking about, whether it applies to the Lifetime Warmup or not (he does bring up
					a few licks that aren’t part of the routine). Even in the e-book PDF that comes with the DVD, Tommy
					describes a few rudiments as “not good drumset rudiment[s] at all”.</p>

				<p>Other ways in which Tommy proves my point include his use of a different rudiment classification
					system, which he probably created since the one on the list of 40 isn’t very good. He also talks
					about the ruff*, one of those “non–rudiments” I mentioned earlier, which not many drummers know
					about in this day and age, probably because it’s not on the list of 40 (and was in fact mangled to
					form the single stroke four and single stroke seven).</p>

				<p>I do think Tommy has a valuable perspective to share, so I just wish he was a bit more frank about
					what the rudiments are and what they offer to a drum set player in the 21st century. I actually
					think he presents the rudiments with the right angle: using them more as conditioning patterns
					rather than something you try to use to make music on the kit. There are many
					valuable patterns in the list of 40, and there are just as many that most drummers don’t ever
					consider, for good reason.</p>

				<p>At the end of the day, these are little more than gripes as I don’t think they significantly hurt the
					DVD’s effectiveness — it’s still a well-produced and coherent project. Overall, <i>Great Hands</i>
					instills
					a healthy attitude towards drumming despite some occasional hokeyness. Some people get irked when
					Tommy downplays the importance of flashy playing, but he’s played on more records with more artists
					than most of the schmucks on Instagram who go try to go viral by vomiting all over their drum set.
				</p>

				<p>In fact, it almost seems like a certain (sullen) filmmaker watched <i>Great Hands for a Lifetime</i>
					and
					proceeded to write a screenplay built around doing the opposite of everything Tommy says, creating a
					rather deluded and dour jazz melodrama.</p>

				<p>Don’t believe me? Well, here I present the world’s lamest art project. You’ll probably recognize the
					screenshots. See if you can figure out where the quotes come from:</p>

				<p> It’s uncanny really.</p>

				<p>*<i>Tommy defines a ruff as a short single–stroke roll ending with an accent. Overall, this might be
						the best definition to use in the 21st century, but maybe I'll talk about this more at a later
						date...</i></p>

			<p class="date"><i>Posted on January 16, 2022</i></p>
			<div class="full-row">

				<img src="../../../images/blog/no-return/no-return-summary.png" alt="No Return Summary"
					id="summary-image">
				<p>This is an unusual topic, but today we’re talking about the theme music for the recently premiered TV
					show <i>Yellowjackets</i>. I don’t know much about the show, except that it has something to do with
					a group of high school soccer prodigies who get involved in a plane crash, as well as their adult
					lives after the fact. Pretty interesting I guess; almost as interesting as the theme music!</p>

				<p>I guess the theme just got put on streaming services this past week because I saw a handful of people
					in the drumosphere separately ask about the tune’s time signature and rhythms. It’s only 90 seconds,
					so I whipped something up and I figured I would share it and talk a bit more about it.</p>

				<p>The theme was composed/performed by Craig Wedren and Anna Waronker, two bandleaders from 90s grunge
					bands (more on that <a
						href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/yellowjackets-music-interview-anna-waronker-craig-wedren/"
						target="_blank">here</a>). As far as I can tell, the drums are programmed. I usually don’t pick
					apart drumming that was cooked up by a guitarist, but I still think there’s something to learn from
					as a songwriter.</p>

				<p>The tune opens up with guitar and drums. The drums are just playing quarter notes on the kick, but
					the guitar riff sounds to be in 3/4 (I’m actually not sure if it’s a bass guitar or if it’s a
					six–string being sent through something like a whammy pedal).</p>

				<p>There’s a surprise bar of 3/8 before the vocals kick in, which is when things get disorienting.
					Here’s a short excerpt with all three parts:</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/no-return/no-return-score-1.png" alt="Score 1" class="centered-image">

				<p>If you count out the vocal rhythm, it sounds like patterns of 2+2+3+2+2+3+2+2+6. Perhaps you could
					consider it a polymeter, but that’s a bit academic. The guitar stays more or less the same, but the
					drums add to the obfuscation with the snare drum being played on beats 1 and 3. Not exactly a
					waltzing feel — in fact, it’s more like a shuffle in this form.</p>

				<p>The second part of the “verse” has an even more confusing rhythm, while an organ part comes in that
					gives the whole thing a 6/8 feel:</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/no-return/no-return-score-2.png" alt="Score 2" class="centered-image">

				<p>I would still count the whole thing in 3/4, as it’s much easier to count the organ in 3/4 than it is
					to count the guitar, drums, and vocals in 6/8.</p>

				<p>There are surprise bars of 7/8, 4/4, and 2/4 that show up in the second part of the tune to subvert
					some of the motifs we heard earlier.</p>

				<p>As is typical with canned drums, some of the details in the transcription might not make a lot of
					sense to someone who tries to sit down behind a kit and play them. Some of the backbeats are played
					in unison with what sounds like a floor tom, while the hi–hat tends to come and go as it pleases.
					The finale also has a flurry of crash cymbal hits that are a bit excessive.</p>

				<p>Since the drums are mixed a bit low, they were really hard to hear during certain sections, such as
					the bit starting around the 1:00 mark. I tried my best, but for something like this, the kick and
					snare are the biggest things to focus on.</p>

			If you’re like me and you’ve ever made the mistake of watching <i>Whiplash</i>, you probably sent your palm through your forehead at <a href="https://youtu.be/xDAsABdkWSc?t=155" target="_blank">the bit</a> where Fletcher points to a metronome marking and tells Andrew to “count me a 215” before he starts going on about “I am to understand that you cannot read tempo?!”. He also calls Andrew a retard, because edgy movie is edgy. If only I knew that the film was just getting started… (more thoughts on that <a href="../whiplash/whiplash.html" target="_blank">here</a>).
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, despite the fact that “read tempo” is a phrase that I’ve never heard a real musician use, you can indeed develop a skill like this. If you see some sheet music that says “♩ = 215” and you don’t have a metronome on you, all you need to do is sing a song that you know was recorded at 215. Voilà. You’ll have a pretty good idea of how fast you’re supposed to play.  It won’t be as accurate as using a click, but it’s a good trick to have if you ever have to deal with a raging shithead band director who doesn’t know how music works. Ahem. Excuse me.
		</p>

		<p>
			Anyhoo, this will be a first in a series of posts called “Know Your Tempos”. I was inspired to do this by Todd Bishop over at Cruise Ship Drummer. He has a few posts <a href="http://www.cruiseshipdrummer.com/search/label/know%20your%20tempos" target="_blank">with this tag</a> where he maps out the tempos of songs by a particular artist. If you get a good mental collection of these things, you’ll have a decent reference for a variety of tempos. Or tempi. Whatever. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I’ll start with Led Zeppelin, because this was the band that made me realize I could use this trick. When I first transcribed <a href="../how-many-more-times/how-many-more-times.html" target="_blank">“How Many More Times”</a> back in 2014, I clocked the song at 144. Whenever I saw a tempo marking around that number, I would just sing the bass line from that tune to get a good idea of how fast to play. Who needs a metronome? I thought I was a genius, but I didn’t think about doing this with any other song…
		</p>

		<p>
			As fun pieces of trivia, “Since I’ve Been Loving You” and “Tea For One” are tied for the slowest Zeppelin songs at 40 BPM. “In The Light” is the slowest 4/4 tune at 64. Tragically, the fastest is “Hot Dog” at 238, although you could count the samba section of “Fool In The Rain” as a fast cut-time, which would bring it to 248. But who knows if that’s how that band did it.
		</p>

		<p>
			For more useless but interesting trivia, the mean Led Zeppelin tempo is 114.7, the median is 104.5, and the mode is 100, which shows up four times.
		</p>

		<p>
			You can download a full .csv file at the bottom of this post to see the BPM of every Zeppelin tune from all 9 albums (with major tempo changes), including the hidden treasure “Hey Hey What Can I Do?”. To make life easier, here’s a highlight reel:

			Kind of a sleepy post this week; my band’s EP has kept me busy. Hopefully I’ll be back next sunday with something more interesting.

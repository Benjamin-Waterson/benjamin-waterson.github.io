			Not much to talk about this week, but last Friday, my band’s debut EP, <i>Natural Born Killer</i>, was released to the public. <a href="../../blog/natural-born-killer/natural-born-killer.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Sorry for my recent unannounced absence — I missed last week’s post after receiving an inoculation last Wednesday that promptly knocked me on my butt for a few days. Once I got over that, it was crunch time for my band’s EP. The last step we had to take was artwork, which ended up falling to me. And with the prospect of pushing this release back again, I had to cook something up in a timely manner.

			But now I can announce that the <i>Natural Born Killer</i> EP has been sent to our distributor, and is on its way to streaming services. At long last, the nightmare is over… on to the next one! After two years on this project, I want to write a bit about the process, since this is the first studio project that I (and my bandmates) we ever a part of, and… we really did a lot of things wrong. So let’s go through it all. <a href="../blog/first-ep-lessons-learned/first-ep-lessons-learned.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

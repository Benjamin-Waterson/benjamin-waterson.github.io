				I don’t give myself lot of opportunities to talk about music that’s hip and contemporary. For one, it takes time to evaluate whether or not a piece of music is really worth dissecting. I am also reminded of a scene from the TV show <i>Bosch</i> where the titular character has a conversation with his friend where his comrade says something to the extent of, “Why don't you listen to music from this century?”, to which Bosch replies, “Because I'm still getting caught up on the last one!”.

			Ever since I wrote about Charlie Watts and <i>Get Yer Ya–Ya’s Out!</i> <a href="../../blog/charlie-watts-midnight-rambler/charlie-watts-midnight-rambler.html" target="_blank">last week</a>, I’ve been on a bit of a classic rock kick, especially with live albums. And so this week, I’m finally going to talk about <i>Live at Leeds</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			It’s hard to fully explain the impact this album has had on me as a drummer. Keith’s playing on this record is just out of this world. Keith is often regarded as a zany, fly–by–the–seat–of–his pants kind of player. But the closer attention I’ve paid to his drumming, the more I’ve appreciated his nuances, as well as how he navigated the arrangements with the rest of the band. <a href="../../blog/amazing-journey/amazing-journey.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Rolo Tomassi was recommended to me a few years ago, sometime after their album Time Will Die and Love Will Bury was released. The song Apple Music gave to me was “Aftermath”, and I really dig the tune. It’s got some rather ethereal verses and a very powerful ending. However, I soon discovered afterward that I had fallen victim to a bit of a bait and switch since most of the band’s catalog consists of some gnarly music with harsh vocals. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			Whatever, this song’s still great. I want to use it as an opportunity to talk more about mixed meter playing since I haven’t written about it much; that is to say, songs that change time signature very often. <a href="../../blog/aftermath/aftermath.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			When I was a freshman in college, I had to deal with the debacle of iCloud and Apple Music destroying my music library. In the midst of that, I rediscovered +44’s one and only album, When Your Heart Stops Beating. +44 was cooked up by Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker after their previous band Blink-182 broke up for the first time. I don’t really remember this album getting released; I think the first time I heard it was around 2007–08. Apparently, it was highly anticipated, so maybe people thought +44 would be the next Blink-182. <a href="../../blog/lycanthrope/lycanthrope.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I probably have 12 or so full–length transcriptions laying around in a WIP folder that I haven’t shared yet, and I’m not really sure if I ever will. At least not in their current form, since note–for–note drum sheet music for an entire track often isn’t necessary. But today, I decided to share my interpretation of Led Zeppelin’s “Ten Years Gone”. I know, a full song! How exciting.			
		</p>

		<p>
			Like “How Many More Times”, this was a Zeppelin song that escaped me for a few years after I first got into the band. I really never gave this track a proper listen until right after I graduated high school. And I must say, the tune is one of Zeppelin’s most engaging and emotional. <a href="../../blog/ten-years-gone/ten-years-gone.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Now that it’s finally warming up, it’s time for some Jimi. I probably shouldn’t let the weather dictate my musical tastes, since (conceptually) music should be able to exist as an artistic statement on its own… but I just don’t feel like listening to Hendrix when it’s snowing outside. I first got into Hendrix in the springtime when things were warming up, although after looking into it, I discovered that two of the three Experience albums (including this one) were released in the winter/fall.

			I have a big list of drummers that I need to listen to more. In fact, for most of the drummers I know of, I have yet to fully explore and appreciate their discographies. When you first hear about an artist, you’re often not sure where to even begin. For many, the simple approach is to just punch something in on YouTube. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			I feel a bit uneasy about doing that; in the case of drummers, you’re likely to get some live drum solo; however, I regard albums to be more musically important (i.e. drumming played on actual records). <a href="../../blog/stars/stars.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Alrighty, time for something a bit more interesting. I found this band about three years ago, when Apple Music recommended them to me. They had just released an album, and this track “Salt of the Earth” was chosen for a new music playlist. It caught my attention right away when it came on. While the band wasn’t familiar, I recognized the drummer Alex Rüdinger after I looked into the group. Alex has played music with a whole slew of bands, most of it being rather intense metal. Not usually my cup of tea, so I wasn’t very familiar with Alex’s playing at this point. <a href="../../blog/salt-of-the-earth/salt-of-the-earth.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Oh, Tommy Igoe… you probably have one of two opinions of him.

I’ve spent quite some time with both, and they’re no doubt ambitious and well done projects.

			Yeah, I should probably know better than to talk about “Hey Joe” in the 21st century. But there’s no denying that it’s an incredible song, despite the rather… <i>disturbing</i> lyrics.
		</p>

		<p>		
			There’s actually some interesting speculation online as to why Jimi decided to make his debut single a cover song about a man who murders his wife and tries to hightail it to Mexico. Discussions usually reference Jimi’s turbulent military service (e.g. being conscripted into the Army and basically kicked out of it) as possibly drawing him to a song about violence, betrayal, and freedom. I’ve even found comments about how the background vocals are meant to represent the ghost of Joe’s wife, haunting over him as he tries to cheat the gallows. <a href="../../blog/hey-joe/hey-joe.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

Gregg did a fantastic job that night; <a href="https://youtu.be/_loihfsCg6Y" target="_blank">his playing on “In A Mellow Tone”</a> swings harder than almost anything else from the show, and he goes very hard on this chart. <a href="../../blog/time-check/time-check.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			This will be the first in a series of posts concerning the 1989 Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship Concert, filmed in Los Angeles at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellissier_Building_and_Wiltern_Theatre" target="_blank">Wiltern Theatre</a>. It’s a night that I consider to be one of the greatest moments in drumming history. Shamefully, it’s difficult to get a personal copy of the show; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Buddy-Memorial-Scholarship-Concerts-Two-Disc/dp/B000GRUQO2" target="_blank">DVD’s</a> haven’t been made since a limited run in 2006 (and as such are obnoxiously expensive), while only snippets are available on YouTube. <a href="../../blog/keep-the-customer-satisfied/keep-the-customer-satisfied.html"><i>Read More. . .</i></a>

			This has been kicking around in my drafts folder for almost exactly one year — I guess now is as good of a time as any to share it with the world. So, last October I saw a post over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/" target="_blank">r/Drums</a> where somebody <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/dfokjs/can_someone_explain_what_is_rhythmically/" target="_blank">asked about</a> the Chon track “Story” off of their 2015 debut. The poster was asking about what was going on at the end of the tune, around the 3:10 mark. <a href="../../blog/story/story.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			What you’re hearing is a guy named Ryo Fukui (福居良). He began his life in music by playing the accordion (like all of us), and then at the age of 22 decided he wanted to be a jazz pianist. And after 6 years of self-taught instruction, he cut his first album, <i>Scenery</i>. <a href="../../blog/early-summer/early-summer.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			It’s finally time for some Keith Moon, the man who got me into drumming. I think <i>Live at Leeds</i> is one of the most important albums for any drummer to listen to, myself especially. I expect that one of these days I’ll take a look at the record; I’m even tempted to do a full note-for-note transcription of it…

		About four years ago, David Garibaldi released <a href="https://www.alfred.com/off-the-record/p/00-41239/" target="_blank">a collection of sheet music</a>, transcriptions he made himself to show off his playing with Tower of Power. I really like it when drummers take a look at their own playing, it’s the best look you’ll probably get at their work. I have the book myself, and it’s a great look at some very busy, dense/harmonic funk drumming. Garibaldi has some nutty drum parts. <a href="../../blog/the-price/the-price.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I’m analyzing a bit of a deep cut, from their oft-forgotten second album <i>Weightless</i> (2011). I wasn’t tuned into Animals as Leaders when it came out, and while I suspect it got the attention it deserves when it was first released, it seems to be overlooked now. <a href="../../blog/odessa/odessa.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			This week, I’m sharing my interpretation of a drumming classic: “Aja” by Steely Dan, with Steve Gadd on drums. I couldn’t gush over this whole record enough, like many drummers and musicians have. But in all seriousness, <i>Aja</i> is one of the most important albums for me as a drummer, and Steve’s solo is one of those moments that totally changes the way you look at the instrument. <a href="../../blog/aja/aja.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Coming at you this week with a full song transcription: “Little Wing” by Jimi Hendrix.

		<p>
			I really got into Hendrix during the spring semester of my senior year in high school, and as I dove into Mitch’s playing, I poked around online for some drum sheet music. This was back when I assumed the average drummer on the internet knew what they were doing when it came to transcribing (or really when it came to anything). <a href="../../blog/little-wing/little-wing.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Welcome to the blog! I have a lot of things to share on my site, and I’ll kick things off with sheet music for the classic “Good Times Bad Times”. Most of the really famous licks are pretty well known, but since it’s such a revered tune I took a detailed look. I don’t have a lot of full-length transcriptions, but with songs like this that are under 3 minutes, it’s not too difficult. <a href="../../blog/good-times-bad-times/good-times-bad-times.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

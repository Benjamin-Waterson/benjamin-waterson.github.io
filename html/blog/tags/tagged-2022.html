		How To Get Started On The Drums
		</h1>
		
		<hr>

		<p>Without a doubt, this is the number one question asked in internet drumming circles. Anyone who asks how to get started on the drums is guaranteed to get at least a few responses, so I’ve never bothered chiming in. I always figured that full–time teachers would be best at responding since they have to routinely get beginners up to speed. But I do have some thoughts to share, and despite my desire to see different topics brought up online, the burden is ultimately on me to come up with stuff to talk about. So let’s go through some pointers. <a href="../getting-started/getting-started.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		Transcription: “No Return” (Theme From <i>Yellowjackets</i>) — Craig Wedren and Anna Waronker
		</h1>

		<p>This is an unusual topic, but today we’re talking about the theme music for the recently premiered TV show <i>Yellowjackets</i>. I don’t know much about the show, except that it has something to do with a group of high school soccer prodigies who get involved in a plane crash, as well as their adult lives after the fact. Pretty interesting I guess; almost as interesting as the theme music! <a href="../no-return/no-return.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		Do Drummers Worry Too Much About Chops? Or Do They Not Worry Enough?

		<p>Who wouldn’t want to kick off the new year with a rant and a rave?</p>

		<p>A few days after Christmas, a pretty innocuous <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/rp0ji8/imagine_this_you_arrive_somewhere_where_there_is/" target="_blank">thread</a> was started on r/drums asking an age-old question: “you sit down on a drum set — what do you start playing?”. I left my go–to answer: “Squib Cakes” by Tower of Power, although some of Steve Gadd’s fills from the Chick Corea tune “Nite Sprite” would be another possibility. <a href="../chops/chops.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I made one of these posts <a href="../2020/2020.html">last year</a>, so I figured that I would make another one for 2021. Maybe this will become an annual thing for me, but I suppose that’s dependent on how eventful my life is year to year. <a href="../2021/2021.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

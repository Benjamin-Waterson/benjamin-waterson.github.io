					For Once and for All: What Is a Ruff on the Drums?

				<img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-summary.jpeg" alt="Ruffs Summary" id="summary-image">
				<p>One of the biggest things I seem to complain about is how drummers can’t seem to agree on what to
                    call a lot of the stuff we play. Six Stroke Roll, Bonham Triplets, Metric Modulation… these terms
                    could mean several different things depending on who’s using them and what the context is.</p>

                <p>The worst casualty of this foible has to be the Ruff. Not many drummers in this day and age use the
                    term ruff, let alone know what exactly it’s supposed to mean. <a

				<p>I really have no business doing this… but there’s no denying that, even 13 years later, the first

				<p>Well, here’s the thing: the drums are programmed. It’s actually pretty obvious. They don’t sound very
					good, the hats and ride cymbals are typically ignored in favor of crash/china cymbal barrages, and a

				<p>I’ve been perusing Pink Floyd’s discography as part of a more ambitious post for next week when I
					realized that I could kill two birds with one stone and whip up a “Know Your Tempos” post. Here’s my
					boilerplate explanation:</p>

				<p>
					If you ever see some sheet music that says “♩ = 215” and you don’t have a metronome on you, all you
					need to do is sing a song that you know was recorded at 215. Voilà. You’ll have a pretty good idea
					of how fast you’re supposed to play. It won’t be as accurate as using a click, but it’s a good trick
					to have… if you get a decent mental collection of these things, you’ll have a good reference for a
					variety of tempos. Or tempi. Whatever.

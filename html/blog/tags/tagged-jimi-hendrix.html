			I just realized that I haven’t done a “Know You Tempos” post in months since I did my first one <a href="../know-your-tempos-led-zeppelin/know-your-tempos-led-zeppelin.html" target="_blank">back in January</a>. So here’s another one of these posts, shamelessly stolen from <a href="http://www.cruiseshipdrummer.com/search/label/know%20your%20tempos" target="_blank">Todd Bishop.</a> I think I’ll just start using a boilerplate description of what “Know Your Tempos” means: <a href="../../blog/know-your-tempos-hendrix/know-your-tempos-hendrix.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Now that it’s finally warming up, it’s time for some Jimi. I probably shouldn’t let the weather dictate my musical tastes, since (conceptually) music should be able to exist as an artistic statement on its own… but I just don’t feel like listening to Hendrix when it’s snowing outside. I first got into Hendrix in the springtime when things were warming up, although after looking into it, I discovered that two of the three Experience albums (including this one) were released in the winter/fall.

			Within different drumming circles, I don’t see the blues discussed much. Everyone wants to know how to play jazz or how to get fluent with double bass, but the blues often get overlooked these days. <a href="../../blog/voodoo-chile/voodoo-chile.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Transcription: “Hey Joe” — Mitch Mitchell with Jimi Hendrix

			Yeah, I should probably know better than to talk about “Hey Joe” in the 21st century. But there’s no denying that it’s an incredible song, despite the rather… <i>disturbing</i> lyrics.

			There’s actually some interesting speculation online as to why Jimi decided to make his debut single a cover song about a man who murders his wife and tries to hightail it to Mexico. Discussions usually reference Jimi’s turbulent military service (e.g. being conscripted into the Army and basically kicked out of it) as possibly drawing him to a song about violence, betrayal, and freedom. I’ve even found comments about how the background vocals are meant to represent the ghost of Joe’s wife, haunting over him as he tries to cheat the gallows. <a href="../../blog/hey-joe/hey-joe.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Coming at you this week with a full song transcription: “Little Wing” by Jimi Hendrix.
		</p>

		<p>
			I really got into Hendrix during the spring semester of my senior year in high school, and as I dove into Mitch’s playing, I poked around online for some drum sheet music. This was back when I assumed the average drummer on the internet knew what they were doing when it came to transcribing (or really when it came to anything). <a href="../../blog/little-wing/little-wing.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I probably have 12 or so full–length transcriptions laying around in a WIP folder that I haven’t shared yet, and I’m not really sure if I ever will. At least not in their current form, since note–for–note drum sheet music for an entire track often isn’t necessary. But today, I decided to share my interpretation of Led Zeppelin’s “Ten Years Gone”. I know, a full song! How exciting.			
		</p>

		<p>
			Like “How Many More Times”, this was a Zeppelin song that escaped me for a few years after I first got into the band. I really never gave this track a proper listen until right after I graduated high school. And I must say, the tune is one of Zeppelin’s most engaging and emotional. <a href="../../blog/ten-years-gone/ten-years-gone.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Now that it’s finally warming up, it’s time for some Jimi. I probably shouldn’t let the weather dictate my musical tastes, since (conceptually) music should be able to exist as an artistic statement on its own… but I just don’t feel like listening to Hendrix when it’s snowing outside. I first got into Hendrix in the springtime when things were warming up, although after looking into it, I discovered that two of the three Experience albums (including this one) were released in the winter/fall.

			Within different drumming circles, I don’t see the blues discussed much. Everyone wants to know how to play jazz or how to get fluent with double bass, but the blues often get overlooked these days. <a href="../../blog/voodoo-chile/voodoo-chile.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Sorry for my recent unannounced absence — I missed last week’s post after receiving an inoculation last Wednesday that promptly knocked me on my butt for a few days. Once I got over that, it was crunch time for my band’s EP. The last step we had to take was artwork, which ended up falling to me. And with the prospect of pushing this release back again, I had to cook something up in a timely manner. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			But now I can announce that the <i>Natural Born Killer</i> EP has been sent to our distributor, and is on its way to streaming services. At long last, the nightmare is over… on to the next one! After two years on this project, I want to write a bit about the process, since this is the first studio project that I (and my bandmates) we ever a part of, and… we really did a lot of things wrong.

I chimed in on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drumming/comments/nadqea/confusion_about_rudiments/" target="_blank">the thread</a> but I feel like expanding on my thoughts more here, since I have yet to talk at length about the rudiments (and there’s a lot to talk about).

			I have a big list of drummers that I need to listen to more. In fact, for most of the drummers I know of, I have yet to fully explore and appreciate their discographies. When you first hear about an artist, you’re often not sure where to even begin. For many, the simple approach is to just punch something in on YouTube. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			I feel a bit uneasy about doing that; in the case of drummers, you’re likely to get some live drum solo; however, I regard albums to be more musically important (i.e. drumming played on actual records). <a href="../../blog/stars/stars.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Alrighty, time for something a bit more interesting. I found this band about three years ago, when Apple Music recommended them to me. They had just released an album, and this track “Salt of the Earth” was chosen for a new music playlist. It caught my attention right away when it came on. While the band wasn’t familiar, I recognized the drummer Alex Rüdinger after I looked into the group. Alex has played music with a whole slew of bands, most of it being rather intense metal. Not usually my cup of tea, so I wasn’t very familiar with Alex’s playing at this point. <a href="../../blog/salt-of-the-earth/salt-of-the-earth.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

Oh, and then there’s that whole business of somebody shooting up the grocery store I used to go to up until barely a year ago.

			There’s actually some interesting speculation online as to why Jimi decided to make his debut single a cover song about a man who murders his wife and tries to hightail it to Mexico. Discussions usually reference Jimi’s turbulent military service (e.g. being conscripted into the Army and basically kicked out of it) as possibly drawing him to a song about violence, betrayal, and freedom. I’ve even found comments about how the background vocals are meant to represent the ghost of Joe’s wife, haunting over him as he tries to cheat the gallows. <a href="../../blog/hey-joe/hey-joe.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

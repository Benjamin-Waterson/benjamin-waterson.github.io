			When it comes to learning jazz, many drummers are often steered towards two very famous books: <i>Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer</i> by Jim Chapin, and <i>The Art of Bop Drumming</i> by Jim Chapin. Both of them are pretty much the default answer online for drummers inquiring about how to learn jazz. I’ve been through both books and I want to write about both of them — since I picked up <i><i>Advanced Techniques</i></i> first, I’ll review it first.  <a href="../blog/advanced-techniques/advanced-techniques.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			This week, I was going to write about <a href="https://mu.se" target="_blank">MuseGroup</a>, the parent company behind MuseScore. Since the start of this summer, there’s been <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/07/13/muse-group-continues-tone-deaf-handling-of-audacity/" target="_blank">a huge kerfuffle</a> involving the MuseGroup’s control of Audacity. Most recently, the MuseGroup has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/audacitys-new-owner-is-in-another-fight-with-the-open-source-community/" target="_blank">vaguely threatening</a> a Chinese expatriate with refoulement in response to a MuseScore downloader browser extension. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The thing is, I don’t really know if I have anything to add to that discussion; much like the rest of the internet, MuseGroup’s behavior is a bit outrageous, and I have some abstract unease about the future of MuseScore.

		Transcription: “Aftermath” — Tom Pitts with Rolo Tomassi

		<p>		
			Rolo Tomassi was recommended to me a few years ago, sometime after their album Time Will Die and Love Will Bury was released. The song Apple Music gave to me was “Aftermath”, and I really dig the tune. It’s got some rather ethereal verses and a very powerful ending. However, I soon discovered afterward that I had fallen victim to a bit of a bait and switch since most of the band’s catalog consists of some gnarly music with harsh vocals. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			Whatever, this song’s still great. I want to use it as an opportunity to talk more about mixed meter playing since I haven’t written about it much; that is to say, songs that change time signature very often. <a href="../../blog/aftermath/aftermath.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			When I was a freshman in college, I had to deal with the debacle of iCloud and Apple Music destroying my music library. In the midst of that, I rediscovered +44’s one and only album, When Your Heart Stops Beating. +44 was cooked up by Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker after their previous band Blink-182 broke up for the first time. I don’t really remember this album getting released; I think the first time I heard it was around 2007–08. Apparently, it was highly anticipated, so maybe people thought +44 would be the next Blink-182. <a href="../../blog/lycanthrope/lycanthrope.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			 	I really have a deep appreciation for well–engraved sheet music. I know sheet music is supposed to have a very utilitarian purpose more than anything else, but there’s something very artful about good sheet music, and I’m not talking sheet music that’s <a href="https://youtu.be/N1lJQt6dAc8" target="_blank">purposefully meant</a> to be a work of art. Without a doubt, there’s also something very… off–putting about sheet music that crams notes on top of one another in a nightmarish web.

At least not in their current form, since note–for–note drum sheet music for an entire track often isn’t necessary. But today, I decided to share my interpretation of Led Zeppelin’s “Ten Years Gone”. I know, a full song! How exciting.			
		</p>

		<p>
			Like “How Many More Times”, this was a Zeppelin song that escaped me for a few years after I first got into the band. I really never gave this track a proper listen until right after I graduated high school. And I must say, the tune is one of Zeppelin’s most engaging and emotional. <a href="../../blog/ten-years-gone/ten-years-gone.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Now that it’s finally warming up, it’s time for some Jimi. I probably shouldn’t let the weather dictate my musical tastes, since (conceptually) music should be able to exist as an artistic statement on its own… but I just don’t feel like listening to Hendrix when it’s snowing outside. I first got into Hendrix in the springtime when things were warming up, although after looking into it, I discovered that two of the three Experience albums (including this one) were released in the winter/fall.

			Sorry for my recent unannounced absence — I missed last week’s post after receiving an inoculation last Wednesday that promptly knocked me on my butt for a few days. Once I got over that, it was crunch time for my band’s EP. The last step we had to take was artwork, which ended up falling to me. And with the prospect of pushing this release back again, I had to cook something up in a timely manner.

			I have a big list of drummers that I need to listen to more. In fact, for most of the drummers I know of, I have yet to fully explore and appreciate their discographies. When you first hear about an artist, you’re often not sure where to even begin. For many, the simple approach is to just punch something in on YouTube.

		<p>

			Alrighty, time for something a bit more interesting. I found this band about three years ago, when Apple Music recommended them to me. They had just released an album, and this track “Salt of the Earth” was chosen for a new music playlist. It caught my attention right away when it came on. While the band wasn’t familiar, I recognized the drummer Alex Rüdinger after I looked into the group. Alex has played music with a whole slew of bands, most of it being rather intense metal. Not usually my cup of tea, so I wasn’t very familiar with Alex’s playing at this point. <a href="../../blog/salt-of-the-earth/salt-of-the-earth.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

I’ve spent quite some time with both, and they’re no doubt ambitious and well done projects. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			On the other hand, you might have a very different opinion of Tommy if you’ve ever browsed his socials, especially his Instagram page. In fact, I often see threads on Reddit from drummers talking about Tommy’s behavior on the internet. <a href="../../blog/jazz-crimes/jazz-crimes.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Depending on how old you are, you may look at the name of this song and thing what the hell kind of band is this? Well, many folks in my generation (and thereabouts) were first introduced to The Fall of Troy via good old <i>Guitar Hero</i>:

			Yeah, I should probably know better than to talk about “Hey Joe” in the 21st century. But there’s no denying that it’s an incredible song, despite the rather… <i>disturbing</i> lyrics.
		</p>

		<p>		
			There’s actually some interesting speculation online as to why Jimi decided to make his debut single a cover song about a man who murders his wife and tries to hightail it to Mexico. Discussions usually reference Jimi’s turbulent military service (e.g. being conscripted into the Army and basically kicked out of it) as possibly drawing him to a song about violence, betrayal, and freedom. I’ve even found comments about how the background vocals are meant to represent the ghost of Joe’s wife, haunting over him as he tries to cheat the gallows. <a href="../../blog/hey-joe/hey-joe.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			In my <a href="../../blog/unpopular-opinions/unpopular-opinions.html">Unpopular Opinions post</a>, I brought up my frustration with drummers throwing around “advanced” music theory terms to look cool, without really investigating these terms mean. I said in that post that there was a chance I would write about this in the future, and here we are. I have four topics to discuss: syncopation, polyrhythm, polymeter, and metric modulation. I want to share my understanding of what these terms mean, and I’ll try to address what seems to be the omnipresent confusion regarding them. <a href="../../blog/advanced-music-theory/advanced-music-theory.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I wanted to make a short post discussing my notation software of choice, MuseScore, since a somewhat <a href="https://musescore.org/en/3.6" target="_blank">significant update</a> just came out at the end of last week. The MuseScore team calls it an “engraving” release, adding some neat features such as default indenting on scores (which I previously always did with a spacer), in addition to a feature that will organize instruments on a conductor score (using templates such as “Orchestra” or “Jazz Band”). Perhaps most significantly, a new music font was added, “Leland”. <a href="../../blog/musescore-3.6/musescore-3.6.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

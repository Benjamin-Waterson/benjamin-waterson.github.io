		What’s the Deal With “Bonham Triplets”?

		<p>(Review: <i>Roll Review</i>… try saying that five times fast!)</p>

		<p>I’m a little bit late to the party on this one, but drummers are still as confused as ever regarding this topic, so here goes.</p>

		<p>After getting into Led Zeppelin back in high school and learning about John Bonham, I became familiar with one of Bonham’s signature licks — “The Bonham Triplet”. <a href="../bonham-triplets/bonham-triplets.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		Drums Don’t Play Actual Pitches. And Even if They Could, Why Would You Want Them To?

		<img src="../../../images/blog/drums-and-pitches/drums-and-pitches-summary.jpg" alt="Drums and Pitches Summary"  id="summary-image">	
		<p>I’m starting to wonder if drummers are on a misguided quest to try and get their instrument to be taken more seriously. I think the metric modulation nonsense that I often <a href="../blog/advanced-music-theory/advanced-music-theory.html" target="_blank">complain about</a> is part of this; other instruments get to talk about advanced harmony, so I get the appeal… but you just end up looking silly to non–drummers.</p>

		<p>There’s another topic I want to look at in the same vein: tuning drums to notes. Like many problems in this day and age, the internet is partly to blame. Case in point: my inspiration to write this comes from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/styzk9/rant_nothing_on_a_standard_drumset_is_a_pitched/" target="_blank">a Reddit thread</a> that was started this past week. As always, I chimed in on the thread and will expand upon my thoughts here. <a href="../drums-and-pitches/drums-and-pitches.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		How To Get Started On The Drums

		<img src="../../../images/blog/getting-started/getting-started-summary.jpg" alt="Getting Started Summary" id="summary-image">	
		<p>Without a doubt, this is the number one question asked in internet drumming circles. Anyone who asks how to get started on the drums is guaranteed to get at least a few responses, so I’ve never bothered chiming in. I always figured that full–time teachers would be best at responding since they have to routinely get beginners up to speed. But I do have some thoughts to share, and despite my desire to see different topics brought up online, the burden is ultimately on me to come up with stuff to talk about.

		<p>Who wouldn’t want to kick off the new year with a rant and a rave?</p>

		<p>A few days after Christmas, a pretty innocuous <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/rp0ji8/imagine_this_you_arrive_somewhere_where_there_is/" target="_blank">thread</a> was started on r/drums asking an age-old question: “you sit down on a drum set — what do you start playing?”. I left my go–to answer: “Squib Cakes” by Tower of Power, although some of Steve Gadd’s fills from the Chick Corea tune “Nite Sprite” would be another possibility. <a href="../../blog/chops/chops.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		<p>Now that I’m the proprietor of a(n admittedly humble) home studio, I like to think that I’ve really come to terms with the nuts and bolts of music technology. But the truth is, I still have a lot to learn, as mastering even a single effect like compression can take some time.</p>

		<p>There are other topics that some people think are best left undiscussed. I’ve really gone on a deep dive in the last couple of months trying to make sense of sample rates, particularly the case for using a high sample rate. <a href="../../blog/high-sample-rates/high-sample-rates.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			A few weeks ago, I fell victim to an unexpected loss of motivation to get a post out. For some reason, I just didn’t feel like writing about anything. The following week I eventually got something together, but it was really a struggle.

		<p>		
			I’m starting to fly by the seat of my pants a little bit with regards to keeping the blog updated. Before I launched the site, I had a few dozen transcriptions that were already done or at least a good chunk of the way done. Sharing the sheet music I’ve created was really the impetus behind this whole thing. <a href="../../blog/writers-block/writers-block.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Sorry for my recent unannounced absence — I missed last week’s post after receiving an inoculation last Wednesday that promptly knocked me on my butt for a few days. Once I got over that, it was crunch time for my band’s EP. The last step we had to take was artwork, which ended up falling to me. And with the prospect of pushing this release back again, I had to cook something up in a timely manner.

		<p>		
			But now I can announce that the <i>Natural Born Killer</i> EP has been sent to our distributor, and is on its way to streaming services. At long last, the nightmare is over… on to the next one! After two years on this project, I want to write a bit about the process, since this is the first studio project that I (and my bandmates) we ever a part of, and… we really did a lot of things wrong.

I chimed in on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drumming/comments/nadqea/confusion_about_rudiments/" target="_blank">the thread</a> but I feel like expanding on my thoughts more here, since I have yet to talk at length about the rudiments (and there’s a lot to talk about).

			So Monday night I was getting ready to watch CU play Florida State in the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/florida-state-vs-colorado-odds-line-2021-ncaa-tournament-picks-march-madness-predictions-from-proven-model/" target="_blank">round of 32</a>, when my excitement was derailed by news of a shooting that happened hours earlier in Boulder. Some jerkoff went to a King Soopers and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/boulder-colorado-shooting-3-24-21/h_ead921802873552ed80a7b776d210a63" target="_blank">killed ten people</a> (including a police officer) before being arrested and hauled off to a hospital.

		<p>Now that it’s fall, it’s time to listen to some Death Cab. I know this particular album came out in May, but… come on.</p>

		<p>This is another chance to talk about modern–day groove maestro Jason McGerr — I still have a few more performances of his to talk about, since he seems to have at least one instance of very inventive playing on each Death Cab album. <a href="../../blog/cath/cath.html.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I finally have a good opportunity to talk about one of my favorite contemporary bands, My Morning Jacket. I also finally have a opportunity to talk about something a bit more recent, as the the band released an album at the end of October. It’s… ok — there are some really good songs, and some others that just don’t work for me. But today, I want to look at the groove from the album closer, “I Could Never Get Enough”. <a href="../../blog/i-never-could-get-enough/i-never-could-get-enough.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		Groove: “Jamie All Over” — Jack Bundrick with Mayday Parade

			Here’s a fun little summertime bop that I’ll share while the season is still around: “Jamie All Over” by Mayday Parade, from their debut A Lesson In Romantics. Mayday Parade was part of a flurry of bands I got into my library back in the day when I would <strike>steal</strike> transfer music from my brother’s library into mine (this was in a time before streaming was a big thing). <a href="../../blog/jamie-all-over/jamie-all-over.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			In the weeks before the 2020 election, I kept seeing these rather hip and sleek ads for the <i>The New York Times</i>. You may know what I’m talking about, have a watch for yourself:

			I haven’t done a “groove of the day/week/month” kind of post on my site yet, but I have something in that vein for you today. While I don’t really know how often I’ll do these, I want to get this particular groove clear for everyone: “Grapevine Fires” by Death Cab For Cutie, off of <i>Narrow Stairs</i> with Jason McGerr on drums. <a href="../../blog/grapevine-fires/grapevine-fires.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

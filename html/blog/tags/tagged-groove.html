				<p>I know that the purpose of this blog isn’t to comment on world events, and I had something else ready
                    to share today… but I guess I need to react somehow.</p>

                <p>There’s actually nothing more to say really, so this is little more than lip service. I just don’t
                    want to come across as too tuned out from the world. <a

					Groove(s): “Glass of Water” + “Death and All His Friends” — Will Champion with Coldplay

				<p>I bet you never thought Coldplay would make it onto the blog!</p>

				<p>Well, I’ll admit, it’s a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. And as I was giving some older music in my
					library a listen, I rediscovered the oft-forgotten Coldplay EP <i>Prospekt’s March</i>, released
					only a few months after the monumental <i>Viva la Vida</i>. The EP has an absolute gem of a deep cut
					called “Glass of Water” — I enjoyed the song quite a bit when I was younger, and all these years
					later I released that the chorus of the track is actually in 7/4! <a

				<p>Now that it’s fall, it’s time to listen to some Death Cab. I know this particular album came out in
					May, but…
					come on.</p>

				<p>This is another chance to talk about modern–day groove maestro Jason McGerr — I still have a few more

					I finally have a good opportunity to talk about one of my favorite contemporary bands, My Morning
					Jacket. I
					also finally have a opportunity to talk about something a bit more recent, as the the band released
					an album
					at the end of October. It’s… ok — there are some really good songs, and some others that just don’t
					work for
					me. But today, I want to look at the groove from the album closer, “I Could Never Get Enough”. <a

					Here’s a fun little summertime bop that I’ll share while the season is still around: “Jamie All
					Over” by
					Mayday Parade, from their debut A Lesson In Romantics. Mayday Parade was part of a flurry of bands I
					got
					into my library back in the day when I would <strike>steal</strike> transfer music from my brother’s

					In the weeks before the 2020 election, I kept seeing these rather hip and sleek ads for the <i>The

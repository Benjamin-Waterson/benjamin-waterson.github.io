		<p>So, I was caught off guard by the recent release of Netflix’s live–action <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> remake. I have heard about a live–action adaptation for over <a href="https://www.firstshowing.net/2008/rumor-keanu-reeves-as-spike-in-cowboy-bebop-movie/#comment-88555" target="_blank">ten years</a> now, but I stopped keeping up with the developments until I started seeing footage from Netflix’s version. And low and behold, it was finally released toward the end of November. <a href="../../blog/too-good-too-bad/too-good-too-bad.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I know I’m gonna sound like a weeb for saying this, but I must thank all the Japanese composers who have spent the last 20 years writing great big band music for their TV shows and video games. I mean, I know there’s probably more <a href="../../blog/the-incredits/the-incredits.html">western entertainment</a> with some killer (original) big band music that I just haven’t found yet… but in the meantime, the Land of The Rising Sun will keep me busy. <a href="../../blog/mario-kart-8/mario-kart-8.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			This week, I was going to write about <a href="https://mu.se" target="_blank">MuseGroup</a>, the parent company behind MuseScore. Since the start of this summer, there’s been <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/07/13/muse-group-continues-tone-deaf-handling-of-audacity/" target="_blank">a huge kerfuffle</a> involving the MuseGroup’s control of Audacity. Most recently, the MuseGroup has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/audacitys-new-owner-is-in-another-fight-with-the-open-source-community/" target="_blank">vaguely threatening</a> a Chinese expatriate with refoulement in response to a MuseScore downloader browser extension. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The thing is, I don’t really know if I have anything to add to that discussion; much like the rest of the internet, MuseGroup’s behavior is a bit outrageous, and I have some abstract unease about the future of MuseScore. So instead, let’s talk about something else. <a href="../../blog/rush/rush.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Even if you’ve never heard this tune before, you should probably conclude by the 15 second mark that it’s a lot of fun to play on pretty much any instrument. And you know what? It is! <a href="../../blog/tank/tank.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			This project has a bit of a story behind it. 
		</p>

		<p>	
			Todd Bishop over at Cruise Ship Drummer is a big fan of practice loops, which he usually makes himself and shares on YouTube. See what they’re all about <a href="http://www.cruiseshipdrummer.com/search/label/practice%20loops" target="_blank">on his website</a>.

			Meanwhile, about seven(!) years ago I was playing <i>Super Mario 3D World</i> for the first time, and I remember really digging the soundtrack, especially for levels like “Chainlink Charge”. <a href="../../blog/chainlink-charge/chainlink-charge.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			We need to take a break from the Buddy Rich Memorial Concert, because I have a special treat this week.			
		</p>

		<p>
			When <i>The Incredibles 2</i> came out ~2 years ago, I gave the original a watch to get ready, and I totally forgot what a killer soundtrack the film has (courtesy of Michael Giacchino). It’s that reason alone that <i>The Incredibles</i> is probably my favorite Pixar film, although I doubt I fully appreciated the score when I was younger. As a fun piece of trivia, this was actually Giacchino’s first Pixar collaboration. And what an effort. <a href="../../blog/the-incredits/the-incredits.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

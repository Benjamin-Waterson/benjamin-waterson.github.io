		Review: <i>Roll Review</i> by Michael Skinner

		<p>(Review: <i>Roll Review</i>… try saying that five times fast!)</p>

		<p>It seems like a lot of musicians have <a href="http://www.cruiseshipdrummer.com/2022/04/get-it-while-you-can-different-drummers.html" target="_blank">gotten hip</a> to the resources afforded by these weird PDF libraries that have popped up across the internet (sites like Scribd, KUPDF, PDFCookie, and PDFCoffee). I don’t know why these sites exist, and I really don’t know why anyone would take the time to scan sheet music and upload it anonymously where it may or may not be seen. Nonetheless, there’s a lot of really interesting stuff out there. <a href="../roll-review/roll-review.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Now that I’ve <a href="../../blog/advanced-techniques/advanced-techniques.html">written about</a> <i>Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer</i>, I don’t want to wait too long before writing about its unofficial companion piece, <i>The Art of Bop Drumming</i> by John Riley. As previously mentioned, both books are go–to answers for the question “how do I learn jazz drumming”. But as I wrote a few months ago, I think Advanced Techniques is a poor introduction to the style and has few musical applications overall. Is <i>The Art of Bop</i> any better? <a href="../../blog/the-art-of-bop/the-art-of-bop.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		Review: <i>Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer</i> by Jim Chapin

			When it comes to learning jazz, many drummers are often steered towards two very famous books: <i>Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer</i> by Jim Chapin, and <i>The Art of Bop Drumming</i> by Jim Chapin. Both of them are pretty much the default answer online for drummers inquiring about how to learn jazz. I’ve been through both books and I want to write about both of them — since I picked up <i><i>Advanced Techniques</i></i> first, I’ll review it first.  <a href="../../blog/advanced-techniques/advanced-techniques.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I don’t really have a schedule for doing reviews and I don’t want to burn through them, but I really enjoyed <a href="../../blog/a-funky-primer/a-funky-primer.html">writing about</a> <i>A Funky Primer</i>, so let’s have another one. I said I would review these books more or less in the order I went through them, but after <i>A Funky Primer</i> I want to jump ahead a bit to another funk book called <i>Advanced Funk Studies</i>, written by Rick Lantham and published in 1980. I think this was the ~4th book I went through. <a href="../../blog/advanced-funk-studies/advanced-funk-studies.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			It was a bit challenging to work on anything especially ambitious this week: I’ve been hard at work finishing up my band’s new website, and we have just one or two more things to take care of for our EP which has been keeping me busy as well. Add to that a bunch of work I’m doing on this site to make it easier to read on mobile. Oh, and then there’s that whole business of somebody shooting up the grocery store I used to go to up until barely a year ago. I guess you could say that’s been messing with my productivity. <a href="../../blog/a-funky-primer/a-funky-primer.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		Movie Review: <i>Sound of Metal</i>

			Whaaa—two posts in one week?! Yeah, I figured I’d slip another post in this week, because I want to quickly share my thoughts on a film I recently watched, <i>Sound of Metal</i>, starring Riz Ahmed as a heavy metal drummer.

			I have to be weary of movies that are about drummers. One the one hand, you have something like <i>Drumline</i>, a flick that’s pretty silly but mostly watchable. Then you also have that other movie about the jazz drummer — the one I try (<a href="../whiplash/whiplash.html">and fail</a>) to pretend doesn’t exist. However, <i>Sound of Metal</i> has a premise more intriguing than any of those other films. <a href="../sound-of-metal/sound-of-metal.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

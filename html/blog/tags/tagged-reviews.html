					Now that I’ve <a href="../../blog/advanced-techniques/advanced-techniques.html">written about</a>
					<i>Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer</i>, I don’t want to wait too long before writing
					about its unofficial companion piece, <i>The Art of Bop Drumming</i> by John Riley. As previously
					mentioned, both books are go–to answers for the question “how do I learn jazz drumming”. But as I
					wrote a few months ago, I think Advanced Techniques is a poor introduction to the style and has few
					musical applications overall. Is <i>The Art of Bop</i> any better? <a

					Review: <i>Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer</i> by Jim Chapin

					When it comes to learning jazz, many drummers are often steered towards two very famous books:
					<i>Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer</i> by Jim Chapin, and <i>The Art of Bop Drumming</i>
					by Jim Chapin. Both of them are pretty much the default answer online for drummers inquiring about
					how to learn jazz. I’ve been through both books and I want to write about both of them — since I
					picked up <i><i>Advanced Techniques</i></i> first, I’ll review it first. <a

					I don’t really have a schedule for doing reviews and I don’t want to burn through them, but I really
					enjoyed <a href="../../blog/a-funky-primer/a-funky-primer.html">writing about</a> <i>A Funky

					order I went through them, but after <i>A Funky Primer</i> I want to jump ahead a bit to another
					funk book called <i>Advanced Funk Studies</i>, written by Rick Lantham and published in 1980. I
					think this was the ~4th book I went through. <a

					It was a bit challenging to work on anything especially ambitious this week: I’ve been hard at work
					finishing up my band’s new website, and we have just one or two more things to take care of for our
					EP which has been keeping me busy as well. Add to that a bunch of work I’m doing on this site to
					make it easier to read on mobile. Oh, and then there’s that whole business of somebody shooting up
					the grocery store I used to go to up until barely a year ago. I guess you could say that’s been
					messing with my productivity. <a href="../../blog/a-funky-primer/a-funky-primer.html"><i>Read More .

					Movie Review: <i>Sound of Metal</i>

					Whaaa—two posts in one week?! Yeah, I figured I’d slip another post in this week, because I want to
					quickly share my thoughts on a film I recently watched, <i>Sound of Metal</i>, starring Riz Ahmed as
					a heavy metal drummer.
				</p>

				<p>
					I have to be weary of movies that are about drummers. One the one hand, you have something like
					<i>Drumline</i>, a flick that’s pretty silly but mostly watchable. Then you also have that other
					movie about the jazz drummer — the one I try (<a href="../whiplash/whiplash.html">and fail</a>) to
					pretend doesn’t exist. However, <i>Sound of Metal</i> has a premise more intriguing than any of
					those other films. <a href="../sound-of-metal/sound-of-metal.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

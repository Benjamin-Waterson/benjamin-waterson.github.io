					<p>
						Happy Holidays everyone! This week, I decided to share something I started a while back and have
						spent some time polishing up: fills and solos from “How Many More Times” off of Led Zeppelin’s
						debut album, with John Bonham on drums.
					</p>
					<p>
						I think it’s appropriate to close out my first year on the site with this tune. The project was
						actually the first “big time” transcription of a song I ever attempted, starting way back in the
						summer of 2014. <a href="../../blog/how-many-more-times/how-many-more-times.html"><i>Read More .

						When I took my deep dive into the <a href="tagged-1989-buddy-rich-memorial-concert.html"

						Whaaa—two posts in one week?! Yeah, I figured I’d slip another post in this week, because I want
						to quickly share my thoughts on a film I recently watched, <i>Sound of Metal</i>, starring Riz

					</p>

					<p>
						I have to be weary of movies that are about drummers. One the one hand, you have something like
						<i>Drumline</i>, a flick that’s pretty silly but mostly watchable. Then you also have that other
						movie about the jazz drummer — the one I try (<a href="../../blog/whiplash/whiplash.html">and
							fail</a>) to pretend doesn’t exist. However, <i>Sound of Metal</i> has a premise more

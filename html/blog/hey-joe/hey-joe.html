				<p>
					Yeah, I should probably know better than to talk about “Hey Joe” in the 21st century. But there’s no
					denying that it’s an incredible song, despite the rather… <i>disturbing</i> lyrics.
				</p>

				<p>
					There’s actually some interesting speculation online as to why Jimi decided to make his debut single
					a cover song about a man who murders his wife and tries to hightail it to Mexico. Discussions
					usually reference Jimi’s turbulent military service (e.g. being conscripted into the Army and
					basically kicked out of it) as possibly drawing him to a song about violence, betrayal, and freedom.
					I’ve even found comments about how the background vocals are meant to represent the ghost of Joe’s
					wife, haunting over him as he tries to cheat the gallows.
				</p>

				<p>
					Is any of that actually true? Who can say… I think the thoughts regarding the background singers are
					a bit fanciful. I’m not even sure whose idea that was, e.g. if it was Jimi or producer Chas
					Chandler. It may have had less to do with making a musical statment and more to do with filling the
					vocals out, since it’s well known that, at this point in his career, Jimi was very insecure about
					his voice.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are still so many interesting parts to the song: a progression that basically uses the circle
					of fifths to move up from C to E; the backing vocals that slowly introduce harmonies until all 4
					parts are added; the walking chromatic riff that first happens right after the solo; and of course
					Mitch’s drumming, which carries the song through a series of increasingly intense climaxes.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you caught <a href="../little-wing/little-wing.html">my “Little Wing” post</a>, you should
					recognize many of Mitch’s moves here, namely a swung 16th note groove with straight 32nd notes
					fills. There’s also the gag with Mitch closing the hats on backbeats during the first verse, as well
					as crashes with the ride. But the fills really are the star of the show, as they demonstrate an
					incredible amount of musicianship and restraint. Mitch starts simple, ending every four bar phrase
					with licks that continue to grow in intensity.
				</p>

				<p>
					One of the early fills comes from a pretty straightforward jazz fill — notice the accent pattern, as
					well as the six stroke roll that’s snuck in there (an actual six stroke roll to boot):
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/hey-joe/hey-joe-triplet-fill.png" class="centered-image"
					alt="Triplet Fill">

				<p>
					There’s a 32nd note fill at measure 31 that’s built with paradiddles. And then there’s the big fill
					right before the guitar solo, which has become one of the most famous drum fills in classic rock:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/hey-joe/hey-joe-guitar-solo-fill.png" class="centered-image"
					alt="Guitar Solo Fill">

				<p>
					Do you recognize the accent pattern? It’s lifted right from the triplet fill we heard earlier. Check
					out the six note phrases:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/hey-joe/hey-joe-guitar-solo-fill-with-phrasing.png"
					class="centered-image" alt="Guitar Solo Fill With Phrasing">

				<p>
					A variation of this fill is heard in measure 46 (around the 2:12 mark) which features some
					orchestrations around the toms.
				</p>

				<p>
					Some of the other highlights include some rather gnarly swing figures with the ride; Mitch really
					shows off his jazz background with these moves. I’m a big fan of this line:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/hey-joe/hey-joe-swing-lick.png" class="centered-image" alt="Swing Lick">

				<p>
					Sorry about the quadruplet. I know I really shouldn’t, but it’s such a convenient way to write only
					a few notes as straight.
				</p>

				<p>
					Also notice how Mitch uses the kick in most of his fills. The kick is a bit burried in the mix, the
					way kick drums on older songs tend to be. There’s a service that was launched recently called <a
						href="https://moises.ai" target="_blank"> Moises</a> that uses some sort of AI/machine learning
					to isolate the instruments in a song. It’s gotten a lot of buzz lately because it actually works.
					Kind of. I tried it out on “Hey Joe”, and while the “isolated” drums are a little garbled, the kick
					comes through pretty clearly, and it was a good way to check some of my work.
				</p>

				<p>
					As always, Mitch’s kit is a mystery. I found <a
						href="https://drummagazine.com/mitch-mitchell-the-hendrix-years/" target="_blank">an article</a>
					from <i>Drum! Magazine</i> where Mitch talks about using a “tiny Ludwig kit” for the early
					Experience rehearsals. Since “Hey Joe” was the first song the band ever recorded, I’m guessing Mitch
					played the tune on this four piece set, with a rack tom and a floor tom. That’s all I can really
					hear on the recording anyway.
				</p>

				<p>
					This was actually one of my earlier projects; I did most of it my freshman year of college. I was
					pretty intimidated by these swing figures at first, and at the time I wasn’t sure if I would be able
					to pull it off. But nowadays? No big deal man.

						With my band’s EP coming out soon, I’ve begun looking at websites that will consolidate music
						streaming links. I found one called Songwhip that I think I will now use to share the songs I
						discuss on my site, since I’ve been too lazy to include anything other than Spotify and Apple
						Music. I sure hope this website doesn’t shut down in a year or two, because that would really
						bum me out.

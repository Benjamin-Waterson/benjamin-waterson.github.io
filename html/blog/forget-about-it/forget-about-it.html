                <p>The Dip is a horn–backed R&B/funk band from Seattle, apparently formed by a group of then jazz
                    students at UW. I was introduced to these guys by my own bandmates — we would use a Dip tune called
                    “Working Man” to open some of our gigs because opening a concert with a <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/JOzoLkXl0J8?t=26" target="_blank">cover can be fun</a>.</p>

                <p>The Dip recently released an album called <i>Sticking With It</i>, and the closer not only lyricizes
                    an
                    acerbic message of class conflict, but lo and behold, it has a drum solo as well!</p>

                <p>While it’s always fun to look at something more contemporary, there’s another reason I wanted to take
                    a look at this track: I actually saw these guys play in Denver this past Sunday. I wanted to post
                    this the day of, but I decided to hold off until after the actual show. It’s just as well since
                    something pretty funny happened a few hours beforehand.</p>

                <p>My friends and I were getting some dinner at a barbecue place right down the street from the theater
                    when out of the corner of my eye I noticed that a group of ironic Caucasian males had walked in.
                    It’s Denver, so I didn’t think much of it at first, until my girlfriend says, “Holy shit, I think
                    that’s the band…”.</p>

                <p>On the off chance any of you guys are reading this, I hope you enjoyed your dinner at Moe’s. Oh, and
                    the show was great fun btw.</p>

                <p>Anyhoo, the solo is a short little 8 bar break played around some ensemble hits. Many drummers use
                    12/8 as an opportunity to play something a bit more spartan comparred to what they would normally
                    play in 4/4. However, the drumming here is pretty dense, with a lot of 16th notes. My favorite
                    moment overall is this 16th note triplet lick:</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/forget-about-it/forget-about-it-triplets.png" class="centered-image"
                    alt="Forget About It Triplets">

                <p>I suspect the sticking used is a combination of a six–stroke triplet and a reverse puh–duh–duh (RLL
                    RRL RRL). Very similar to a paradiddle puh–duh–duh pattern I’ve always called the jazz–a–diddle (RLR
                    RLL RLL).</p>

                <p>There’s also the occasional double/buzz stroke played on the snare. Since the cymbal plays steady
                    16ths for much of the solos, these doubles and buzzes are played in unison with a right–hand single,
                    which can take a bit of practice to get down.</p>

                <p>Sorry for stretching single measures of 12/8 across the page, but two bars to a system just looked
                    too squashed. And the 16th note triplets were a real hassle. I’m not sure there’s a great way to
                    deal with crowded measures of 12/8…</p>

					<b>Edit:</b> Since having first wrote this post, I’ve decided to comment it out from the rest of the
					site. I stand by what I’ve written, but this whole post just feels so out of place on my blog, since
					I haven’t really gotten political in this sense since this one. I’ll leave the post up for anyone
					who might happen to have the URL and actually cares about what I had to say.
				</p>

				<p>
					So Monday night I was getting ready to watch CU play Florida State in the <a
						href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/florida-state-vs-colorado-odds-line-2021-ncaa-tournament-picks-march-madness-predictions-from-proven-model/"
						target="_blank">round of 32</a>, when my excitement was derailed by news of a shooting that
					happened hours earlier in Boulder. Some jerkoff went to a King Soopers and <a
						href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/boulder-colorado-shooting-3-24-21/h_ead921802873552ed80a7b776d210a63"
						target="_blank">killed ten people</a> (including a police officer) before being arrested and
					hauled off to a hospital.
				</p>

				<p>
					It’s a bit chilling for me, since I used to go to that store all the time. When I was a student at
					CU, I lived in a neighborhood called Martin Acres that was maybe two minutes away. That King Soopers
					was where I went to get my groceries. I also noticed that it’s a popular hangout for
					middle–schoolers and high–schoolers.
				</p>

				<p>
					I really have to re-evaluate my political stance whenever this happens. I am a gun owner. I frequent
					places like <span class="word-break"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/liberalgunowners/"
							target="_blank">r/liberalgunowners</a></span> and the <a href="https://socialistra.org"
						target="_blank">Socialist Rifle Association</a>. I like the idea of citizens being armed. I
					don’t like the idea of American law enforcement being the only folks with guns. I feel empowered as
					a person who knows how to shoot. But when stuff like this happens, well... I feel like an asshole.
				</p>

				<p>
					We don’t have a good discussion about gun deaths in this country. People like to throw around
					numbers such as “<a href="https://time.com/5479993/gun-deaths-us-cdc/" target="_blank">30,000–40,000
						gun deaths</a> in the US every year”. Most of those deaths are <a
						href="https://harvardpolitics.com/suicide-gun-related-deaths/" target="_blank">suicide</a> (~60
					to 70%). Most gun homicides are concentrated to <a
						href="		https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/jan/09/special-report-fixing-gun-violence-in-america"
						target="_blank">big cities</a>. Crime across the country has been <a
						href="		https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/"
						target="_blank">decreasing</a> since the 90’s. The odds of being randomly shot in a mass
					shooting are very, very low. And yet, it certainly is the case that those odds are still
					unacceptable.
				</p>

				<p>
					I’m frustrated by the fact that mass shootings seem to be the only vessel that spurs a national
					discussion about gun legislation. Growing up in the Bay Area, I never noticed a spike in local
					murders leading to any sort of nationwide conversation. But I’m just as guilty, insofar as I only
					have these introspective moments when there are mass shootings. Even without these events, loads of
					people are still getting shot in this country, more so than any other comparable nation.
				</p>

				<p>
					Each years passes by with similar amounts of gun deaths, but it’s rarely the case that suicide or
					inner–city violence works an impetus for lawmaking. Some publications will actually <a
						href="https://injepijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40621-019-0226-7"
						target="_blank">exclude gang violence</a> in their definitions of mass shootings. It’s as if
					we’ll cite those statistics, but only after <i>certain</i> people (affluent white people) get shot
					where they’re not <i>supposed</i> to get shot (the grocery store). But aren’t we just splitting
					hairs? I’d say <i>nobody</i> is <i>supposed</i> to get shot anywhere.
				</p>

				<p>
					What do we do? The Boulder assault weapons ban has gotten a lot of buzz lately. It was passed in
					2018 and faced <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/news/10th-circuit-says-gun-control-opponents-must-wait-for-state-court-to-act-on-boulder/article_6b6a31e0-7d81-11ea-a83b-17c38c153d10.html
" target="_blank">immediate challenges</a> — the beef was that the Boulder City law was incompatible with the supremacy
					clause of the state constitution. I’m not sure to what extent the law had any enforcement mechanism
					before it was struck down a few weeks ago. In addition, the shooter wasn’t even from Boulder.
				</p>

				<p>
					California passed an AWB in 2001. I can’t say I feel any safer traveling to Alameda with such a law
					in place. The US had a national AWB for 10 years starting in 1994. There are arguments going both
					ways as to what extent it <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban#Effects" target="_blank">did
						anything good</a>. The issue is that definitions of “assault weapons” usually hone in on
					ergonomic features (pistol grip, telescopic stock) and magazine sizes more so than caliber or
					action. In some circles, these laws are derisively referred to as “scary black rifle” laws.
				</p>

				<p>
					I suppose we would need to change our definition of “assault” weapon. Many folks as of late have
					been drawn to banning all semi–automatic weapons, perhaps with capacity limits. At this point I
					imagine we’d be facing some serious legal challenges. I also have to wonder if a ban on semi–auto
					weapons would just change the way people shoot each other. Instead of running around spraying and
					praying, someone might just hunker down somewhere and take pot shots at people with a five shot bolt
					action rifle for 90 minutes. But who would do <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_tower_shooting" target="_blank">such a
						thing</a>?
				</p>

				<p>
					So what does that mean? Total gun confiscation? Intuitively, that would have to work... wouldn’t it?
					Philosophizing aside, I’d reckon it’s a pipe dream to hope for anything of that sort. On top of how
					pathetically useless Congress already is, the <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller" target="_blank">modern
						interpretation</a> of the Second Amendment is that it guarantees American citizens the right to
					possess a gun for defense. The only sure–fire way to change that is another amendment, which is
					perhaps the most difficult thing to do in American politics. Meanwhile, the current makeup of the
					Supreme Court likely means that <i>any</i> gun laws could be challenged and struck down for the next
					generation or so. And even if we overcome all of that, I can’t imagine the infrastructure needed for
					gun collection, since there are so many guns out there in the country. Who knows what would even
					happen.
				</p>

				<p>
					Like most of the problems facing this country, we have apparently dug ourselves into a hole. Do we
					have another option? I find it conspicuous that the some of the biggest spikes in the national
					homicide rate occurred when Prohibition was passed, and then when the Controlled Substance Act was
					passed. Might as well throw in the “tough on crime” era of the 1990’s:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/this-week-in-boulder/this-week-in-boulder-crime-graph.png"
					class="centered-image" alt="Crime Graph">

				<p>
					Why are murders in the country declining? Is it because of changes in drug legislation? Is it
					because Americans are drinking less? Is it because of lead abatement? It could be both all of the
					above. But the discussion about gun control doesn’t concern these murders. If the United States had
					100 gun deaths each year and every last one of them came from a mass shooting, we’d still be having
					the same conversion. And that’s totally fair.
				</p>

				<p>
					The curious thing is that more and more women and minorities are <a href="https://19thnews.org/2020/11/women-lgbtq-buying-guns-2020/
" target="_blank">buying guns</a>. Who could blame them? By all accounts, the guns aren’t going anywhere; might as well
					get some. Gun rights are minority rights after all. With regards to our suspect, it’s mostly the
					same old story: male, in his 20’s, with some sort of AR-15 clone. He doesn’t have a stereotypically
					“white” sounding name, which probably means he has already become fodder for discussion of
					terrorism. Beforehand, I thought the only remarkable thing about his case was his portly stature and
					his arrest in boxers.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is a uniquely American problem, just like everything else that’s wrong with this country. Is it
					a question of mental health? Well, maybe — we empirically have <a
						href="https://youtu.be/aNghg1Y-WIc?t=197" target="_blank">the worst healthcare</a> of any
					developed nation. Most of the countries with lower rates of gun violence have <a
						href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171003213733if_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/web/20171003213733if_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-used-to-think-gun-control-was-the-answer-my-research-told-me-otherwise/2017/10/03/d33edca6-a851-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html?utm_term=.212ff3224f06">always
						had</a> lower rates of gun violence; they also happen have some sort of universal healthcare
					system. Friendly reminder to the right–wingers out there that medicare for all also means mental
					healthcare for all. And it certainly doesn’t help that Americans are generally <a
						href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/"
						target="_blank">overworked, miserable people</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Many people talk about “common sense” gun laws. I’d say single–payer is a common sense law, but most
					of the Democratic party will talk more about AR-15’s than giving you healthcare. But let’s stay
					focused. <b>Competent</b> background checks are a good idea (the killer in Boulder was arrested
					three years ago; in addition, he was apparently known to the FBI, and yet he passed his background
					checks). I generally think waiting periods are a good idea (the Boulder killer got his weapon less
					than a week beforehand). We probably need some sort of licensing system. I think when you buy a gun,
					you need to deliver a practical demonstration that you know how your particular model works. Proof
					of safe storage is also a good idea.
				</p>

				<p>
					All this musing is still cold comfort for the people who randomly get shot for going about their
					business. At the end of the day, I wonder if I have to put my political ideations aside and come
					back down to planet Earth. This country has a lot of guns. Lots of people get shot in this country.
					Is there really <i>no</i> connection? But hey, it's not like the country does <i>anything</i> good
					for you, unless you’re either rich, a giant corporation, or a defense contractor.
				</p>

				<p>
					Oh, by the way… CU lost the game. The women’s team lost the same day as well. Not that it really
					matters.

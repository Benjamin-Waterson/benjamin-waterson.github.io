					This will be the first in a series of posts concerning the 1989 Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship
					Concert, filmed in Los Angeles at the <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellissier_Building_and_Wiltern_Theatre"
						target="_blank">Wiltern Theatre</a>. It’s a night that I consider to be one of the greatest
					moments in drumming history. Shamefully, it’s difficult to get a personal copy of the show; <a
						href="https://www.amazon.com/Buddy-Memorial-Scholarship-Concerts-Two-Disc/dp/B000GRUQO2"
						target="_blank">DVD’s</a> haven’t been made since a limited run in 2006 (and as such are
					obnoxiously expensive), while only snippets are available on YouTube. Alfred offers a stupid <a
						href="https://www.alfred.com/buddy-rich-memorial-scholarship-concerts/p/00-908125/"
						target="_blank">digital streaming thing</a> if you want to watch it on their website, broken up
					into chapters. I’ll save you the trouble, it’s a pain to use if you want to rip the concert to your
					library. It also has stupid shit like these annoying right-channel clicks on Dave Weckl’s
					performance. Of course, the clicks are nowhere to be heard on VHS rips. What a joke. I ended up
					using the streaming thing to rip audio into my library, while using Rx7 to clean up the clicks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several of these memorial gigs are reported to have happened, but only 3 of them were recorded: this
					one, the 1992 show, and a <a
						href="https://www.alfred.com/buddy-rich-memorial-concert-2008/p/93-DV10011201/"
						target="_blank">2008 show</a>. I really don’t know how many of these concerts have taken place.
					I’ve seen vague references <a href="houseofdrumming.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1026&hilit=BRMC"
						target="_blank">on forums</a> to a performance earlier in 1989, and other references <a
						href="https://sabian.com/article/dave-weckl-gregg-potter-to-perform-at-buddy-rich-25th-anniversary-memorial-concert/"
						target="_blank">to ones from ’88 and 2012</a>, but nothing in the way of helpful details.
					Personally, I think the ’89 concert is the best of the three official ones, in terms of performances
					and recording. The band and the drums all sound amazing — the head engineer for the show was Jack
					Jospeh Puig, ICYWW. I wish I could speak as highly of the clowns that maintained the footage over
					the years.
				</p>
				<p>

					The lineup from the ’89 concert includes Louis Bellson, Gregg Bissonette, Dennis Chambers, Dave
					Weckl, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Steve Gadd (check out the setlist <a
						href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91NSTwXIdmL._SL1500_.jpg"
						target="_blank">here</a>). It’s this concert that gave us the <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7h6hOs_ySw" target="_blank">famous drum-off featuring</a>
					Vinnie, Steve, and Dave. You can see what the idea was, getting the best drummers in America and
					having them rock out two charts each with Buddy’s band. I have a hunch there were supposed to be
					more than ~3 of these things; in fact the plan could have even been to make them an annual event. I
					think the scholarship <a href="https://www.pas.org/get-involved/scholarships-grants"
						target="_blank">still exists</a>, under a different name.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyway, I have something from every drummer to share, so I’ll be making a post about all six of
					them. I’m starting off with Steve, because why not? I figured this week was an appropriate time to
					start: the 31st anniversary of the concert is this Wednesday, October the 14th.
				</p>
				<p>

					The tune in particular is “Keep The Customer Satisfied”, originally written by Paul Simon and
					arranged here by Bill Holman. I don’t know how Buddy became such a fan of this track, since it
					doesn’t seem like he had a high opinion of pop music, but whatever. The chart calls for an open drum
					solo in the middle of the tune, and Steve plays one of the more modest solos of the night.

					There are a lot of familiar licks that Steve Gadd fans should recognize: open-handed hi hat playing,
					the Gadd-a-macue, swung six-stroke rolls, and offbeat hertas. Notice how most of the solo is
					straight, giving Steve the opportunity to do stuff like whip out a variation of his <a
						href="https://www.drummerworld.com/Videos/stevegaddbasic.html" target="_blank">paradiddle
						groove</a> — well, this version doesn’t really feature paradiddles but he’s going for a similar
					thing:

				<p>

					Notice this cool little call and response thing Steve does with himself at the 3:58 mark:
				</p>

					class="centered-image" alt="Call and Resposne">
				<p>

					It starts with triplet five-stroke rolls before a bar of his usual herta fills. He then straightens
					out the five-stroke roll as sixteenths, before a gnarly measure of hertas mixed with sixteenth notes
					triplets on the kick.
				</p>
				<p>

					He ends the solo with his take on the Bonham Triplet, played as nonuplets (one of my favorite
					tuplets):

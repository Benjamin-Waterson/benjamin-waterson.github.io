				<img src="../../../images/blog/musescore-3.6/musescore-3.6-summary.jpg" alt="MuseScore 3.6 Summary"
					id="summary-image">

				<p>
					I wanted to make a short post discussing my notation software of choice, MuseScore, since a somewhat
					<a href="https://musescore.org/en/3.6" target="_blank">significant update</a> just came out at the
					end of last week. The MuseScore team calls it an “engraving” release, adding some neat features such
					as default indenting on scores (which I previously always did with a spacer), in addition to a
					feature that will organize instruments on a conductor score (using templates such as “Orchestra” or
					“Jazz Band”). Perhaps most significantly, a new music font was added, “Leland”.
				</p>
				<p>
					Music fonts change the appearance of the actual music on the paper, and for a long time, MuseScore
					users (like myself) looked to Finale and Sibelius with a bit of envy, as these programs have many
					options for music fonts. When I started using MuseScore (ver 1.3), there were only three fonts
					available: Emmentaler, which is the same font <a href="http://lilypond.org"
						target="_blank">Lilypond</a> uses, presumably inspired by an unknown publisher; Bravura, a font
					created for <a href="https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/" target="_blank">Dorico</a> that takes its
					inspiration from Sonata, the world’s oldest music font (commissioned by Adobe in 1985 to work with
					the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript" target="_blank">PostScript langauge</a>); and
					Gonville, built by software developer <a
						href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/gonville/" target="_blank">Ian Jackson</a>,
					and based off of Emmentaler.
				</p>

				<p>
					After 5 years of discussion, MuseScore finally implemented a lead-sheet style font in 2018 called
					MuseJazz, which until now was the only music font update. The developers have explained that music
					fonts must be built into MuseScore to be used, meaning that they have to be extensively modified to
					work with the software, in addition to having the appropriate license. So most of these third party
					fonts can’t be used with the software.
				</p>

				<p>
					Leland is meant to be MuseScore’s new default. It takes its inspiration from <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCORE_(software)" target="_blank">SCORE</a>, an increasingly
					obscure scorewriter created by Leland Smith in the 80’s — it actually predates Finale by one year,
					and it apparently was the first scorewriter to get any professional use (which continued well into
					the 21st century). However, Smith seems to have made the decision that when he would die, SCORE
					would die with him; he <a href="https://www.scoringnotes.com/news/leland-smith-dies-at-88/"
						target="_blank">passed away</a> in December of 2013 and SCORE hasn’t been updated since. The <a
						href="http://scoremus.com" target="_blank">website</a> is defunct and software has basically
					been deserted by its developers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Smith spent a lot of time investigating how real engraving works (i.e. talking to the poor folks who
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvyoKdW-Big" target="_blank">carve notation</a> backwards
					into metal), so the program quickly became esteemed for its output. MuseScore head of design Martin
					Keary worked with professional engraver Simon Smith (a long time SCORE user) to build the new font.
					Here’s a random ditty I cooked up to show off the new update, with my usual cleanups:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/musescore-3.6/musescore-3.6-leland-demo.png" class="centered-image"
					alt="Leland">

				<p>
					At first glance, I really like the look of the time signatures, dynamics, and accents. I have mixed
					feelings about the the parentheses I use for ghost notes; while they look a little too small and are
					hard to catch, I do think they have a very efficient use of space. Moreover, I find several elements
					to be just too thin — I feel like the X noteheads get drowned out by the normal noteheads, and the
					china cymbal notehead looks a bit small too. Interestingly, the developers sepcifically said that
					they wanted to avoid making the font look thin and unsubstantial. I have the same issue with most of
					the rests... there’s just something off about the rests for eight notes and up. They look thin and
					wispy. Perhaps they look better when printed, but I’m under the impression that this was made with a
					digital focus.
				</p>

				<p>
					Meanwhile, the “marcato” accents look a bit too wide for me. There’s also something funny going with
					the flags. I notice it most with the flam grace note (acciaccatura). I usally push the grace note
					closer to the anchor note becuase it looks better, but with Leland the grace note’s flag gets way
					too close to the anchor notehead. The flags are also much too close to augmentation dots. And
					lastly, my tambourine notehead in the 3/4 bar looks almost indentical to my ride bell notehead in
					the measure before. Here’s the same excerpt with Emmentaler and my typefaces:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/musescore-3.6/musescore-3.6-emmentaler-demo.png" class="centered-image"
					alt="Emmentaler">

				<p>
					I think I’ll stick with Emmentaler for now. I’m very tempted to switch (mainly because of the ghost
					notes), but I think there’re just too many problems with it. I do admire the work that went into
					this; the more of these fonts MuseScore has, the better. They can go a long way to give a score some
					personality. I suppose I could use the symbols pallet to combine the parts I like from Leland with
					Emmentaler... but that would be very tedious and time consuming. And as a MuseScore user, that’s
					really saying something!
				</p>

				<p>
					I still have to make some routine adjustments to ensure that the score looks good: adding space to
					ghost note parentheses, pushing flams closer to main notes, fixing weird stem lengths, and fixing
					tuplet brackets with crazy slopes (sadly, there’s still no way to force horizontal on tuplets
					brackets). I guess I’ll have to hold out for MuseScore 4 to see these fixed (if they ever do get
					fixed).
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly, the team added a new default typeface called “Edwin”, based on <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_type_family#Century_Schoolbook" target="_blank">New
						Century Schoolbook</a>. Since I labored over what typface would look good on my site as well as
					my scores (not to mention the all typefaces I found for tuplets and the like), I’m not sure if and
					when I’ll be using Edwin. It does look nice for chord symbols, so I’m tempted to replace Bitstream
					Charter, my current chord symbol typeface. I must say that the bold font is way too heavy however,
					so I have some thinking to do...

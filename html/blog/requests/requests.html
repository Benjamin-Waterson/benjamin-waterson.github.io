			In the weeks before the 2020 election, I kept seeing these rather hip and sleek ads for the <i>The New York Times</i>. You may know what I’m talking about, have a watch for yourself:

			It certainly gets your attention, especially with that music. I wound up tracking the tune down; it’s a song called “Requests”, by jazz drummer Makaya McCraven. I haven’t taken much of a look at McCraven’s playing, but he’s definitely one of the bigger names in jazz at the moment. The track is off an album called <i>In The Moment</i>, which is full of these short numbers, much of them done live and ad-libbed with lots of looping — they’re kind of like little jam vignettes.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I must say that I’m very impressed with <i>The New York Times</i> on this one. Maybe they thought this would make up for their inexplicable endorsement of Elizabeth Warren and Amy goddamn Klobuchar for the 2020 Democratic nominee. Even after reading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/19/opinion/amy-klobuchar-elizabeth-warren-nytimes-endorsement.html
" target="_blank">the article</a>, I still can’t imagine what they were thinking. Whatever, I guess there are more important things to worry about right now.

			<b>Anyway</b>, McCraven plays a very slinky groove during the intro. It sounds much more difficult than it actually is; everything is basically built around singles and puh-duh-duhs. All he needed to do was add in some hi hat pedal, then drummers all over the internet would be drooling over his #gospelchops<sup>TM</sup>. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I very much like the pattern the way it is. It grooves hard, but it’s also slightly disorienting. The rest of the tune is basically a short jam. It eventually gets a little too bebop-y for my tastes, but that first groove is still killing.

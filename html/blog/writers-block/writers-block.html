		<p>		
			A few weeks ago, I fell victim to an unexpected loss of motivation to get a post out. For some reason, I just didn’t feel like writing about anything. The following week I eventually got something together, but it was really a struggle.
		</p>

		<p>		
			I’m starting to fly by the seat of my pants a little bit with regards to keeping the blog updated. Before I launched the site, I had a few dozen transcriptions that were already done or at least a good chunk of the way done. Sharing the sheet music I’ve created was really the impetus behind this whole thing. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			But <a href="../tags/tagged-transcription.html">transcriptions</a> are a lot of work. Just selecting material to pick apart can be challenging enough. Then I have to notate the selection by ear, proofread it the best I can, properly engrave everything so it looks nice, write the actual text of the post, proofread that, and then finally share it. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			<a href="../tags/tagged-chart.html">Charts</a> and <a href="../tags/tagged-groove.html">grooves</a> don’t take as much work; the issue here is just picking the right kind of music. 
		</p>

		<p>	
			<a href="../tags/tagged-reviews.html">Book reviews</a> and the <a href="../tags/tagged-know-your-tempos.html">“Know Your Tempos”</a> posts aren’t terribly difficult, as writing normally comes easy to me. I just don’t want to rip through all of the books and bands that I really appreciate, since it can take a few years to really appreciate a book or an artist’s catalog. 
		</p>

		<p>	
			<a href="../tags/tagged-rants-and-raves.html">Rants & Raves</a> can be some of my favorite posts, so long as I have something interesting to write about. But the sad reality is that there aren’t a lot of interesting discussions happening in the drumming world right now.
		</p>

		<p>		
			The biggest drumming circle I’m a part of is Reddit, where I frequent a few different drumming subs. And a lot of the stuff that I see get posted doesn’t really give me any material to work with.
		</p>

		<p>		
			Most of the posts are people sharing photos of their drums, which is cool. There are videos of people basically showing off, but most of the stuff I see doesn’t really interest me musically. And then there are a lot of beginner questions as well: how to hold drumsticks, what kind of drum kit to buy, etc. I guess I could talk about those to some degree, but I can only answer the same question once, even though the same question gets asked over and over again. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			There always seem to be fascinating discussions and questions happening on places like r/MusicTheory. Take <a href="../../../images/blog/writers-block/writers-block-music-theory.png" target="_blank">this one</a> for example. I really don’t see anything like that happening regularly in the drum world. Sometimes it’s hard to even imagine anything like that happening. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			I’m not even sure what I would like to see, but I want to see something since I really enjoy talking about drums. But I need something to talk about!
		</p>

		<p>		
			I’ve cooked up a few topics that I might be able to write about long–form. But I can’t be sure if they will work. When I wrote about the world’s first drum set book, I didn’t know if I would be able to get to the bottom of anything. If I didn’t wind up with a good answer, I may have had to scrap the whole post and then try to come up with something else late in the week. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			I remember seeing a post recently on r/drums where someone was bemoaning the lack of substantive discourse on the subreddit, much like I am right now. I think the post got deleted by whoever started it; I saw a few comments that basically said “lol dude that’s your problem”. And maybe it is.
		</p>

		<p>		
			I am aware of the old–school drumming forums like Drummerworld that have about the same amount of users as something like r/drums. I guess I could start perusing them, but I don’t know if I have the time to frequent all these different groups. Maybe I do though; it seems like it would certainly cut down on the general silliness I see on Reddit…
		</p>

		<p>		
			I still want to diversify the material on my site. I’ve only scratched the surface of sharing original practice material, and hopefully the more time I spend writing, recording, and producing music will give me more insights to share. And of course, I haven’t talked about any web development stuff yet either. Maybe there’s a way to repurpose those posts I always seem into something that would be more interesting for me to write about. So stay tuned…

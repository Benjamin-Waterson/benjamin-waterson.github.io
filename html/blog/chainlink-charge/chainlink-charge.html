					This project has a bit of a story behind it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Todd Bishop over at Cruise Ship Drummer is a big fan of practice loops, which he usually makes
					himself and shares on YouTube. See what they’re all about <a
						href="http://www.cruiseshipdrummer.com/search/label/practice%20loops" target="_blank">on his
						website</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Meanwhile, about seven(!) years ago I was playing <i>Super Mario 3D World</i> for the first time,
					and I remember really digging the soundtrack, especially for levels like “Chainlink Charge”. Around
					that time, Nintendo got a bit obsessed with using jazz in their games.
				</p>

				<p>
					Jump ahead to 2019 when I was playing <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>, which again had a lot of jazz
					tunes in its OST. And whenever I looked up these songs online, I would find videos that were all
					upwards of 30 minutes in length. At this point I sort of had an “ah–ha” moment: since the actual
					songs are only a minute or two long, these videos are basically practice loops. Check out the theme
					for “Chainlink Charge” (also known as “Athletic Theme”) and tell me that this doesn’t sound like
					fun:
				</p>

				</div>

				<p>
					It’s a pretty neat track for practicing some upbeat swing. I cooked up a chart for the tune, and I
					got kind of cutesy with it, designing like a lead sheet/fake book. Not as fancy looking as what I
					did for <a href="../the-incredits/the-incredits.html">“The Incredits”</a>, but stuff like this is
					cool opportunity to try out some different approaches. The engraving is a little but lazy, the way
					handwritten charts tend to be.
				</p>

				<p>
					You may have noticed that I used new MuseScore font called Petaluma, which was created a couple of
					years ago by Steinberg, the folks behind Dorico and another font called Bravura. Petaluma had a few
					issues when it was added with the 3.6 update, but these were recently patched up. I considered
					engraving it by hand, but… there wasn’t a chance that was going to work out. I have some other
					Nintendo practice loops I’ve charted, and I think I’ll be using this style for them. I’ll save
					MuseJazz for the big time charts.
				</p>

				<p>
					I can hear the drummer using brushes on the original recording, but I can’t say for sure that the
					tune calls for them. Whatever, just play what feels right, and see if you can make it through all 30
					minutes.
				</p>

				<p>
					By the way, if you’re reading this sometime in the future and the video I linked is long gone, just
					check out the audio <a href="../../../audio/blog/chainlink-charge/chainlink-charge.m4a">here</a>.

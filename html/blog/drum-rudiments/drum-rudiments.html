					id="summary-image">
				<p>
					Earlier this week, someone posted on r/drumming asking about the rudiments. I chimed in on <a
						href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drumming/comments/nadqea/confusion_about_rudiments/"
						target="_blank">the thread</a> but I feel like expanding on my thoughts more here, since I have
					yet to talk at length about the rudiments (and there’s a lot to talk about). The OP was specifically
					asking about what is and isn’t a rudiment (i.e. why is this lick a rudiment, but not that one).
				</p>

				<p>
					I feel like this is a common question, but I don’t see it asked/discussed very often on the
					internet. Perhaps most drummers don’t want to question the almighty rudiment list. But when I was
					younger, I certainly remember looking at the list of 40 and thinking: <i>ok, there’s a double stroke
						roll (RR LL) and a triple stroke roll (RRR LLL), but why is there no quadruple stroke roll (RRRR
						LLLL) or quintuple stroke roll (RRRRR LLLLL)?</i>
				</p>

				<p>
					The OP shared similar thoughts regarding the short rolls, of which there are nine:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/drum-rudiments/drum-rudiments-short-rolls.png" class="centered-image"
					alt="Short Rolls">

				<p>
					You may look at the above and feel confused as to how you’re supposed to remember all that — again,
					back in the day I remember asking myself: <i>hold on, is there a 12 stroke roll on the list? What
						about a 19 stroke roll?</i> To the extent that there’s any system behind it, it’s all of the odd
					numbers from five to seventeen, plus six and ten.
				</p>

				<p>
					Obviously, the list can’t have <b>every</b> short roll or hand–to–hand roll; otherwise, the list
					would never end! These patterns are supposed to be rudimental after all, so a line has to be drawn
					somewhere.
				</p>

				<p>
					But even with the list’s (ostensible) intention of presenting essential building blocks to the
					drummer, it’s still hard to make sense of why the list has weird stuff like two different drag
					paradiddles or three ratamacue variations. What’s the deal with that? I mean, aren’t there more
					important licks to include? Well, the answer is in the history of the rudiments.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you research the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_rudiment#History" target="_blank">
						history of the rudiments</a>, you’ll often find unwieldy discussions about the history of
					military snare drumming in general. Most of that isn’t terribly important. Things really started
					developing in the 1800s, when the world’s first drum books were published. These authors (who all
					came from a marching background) were trying to name and notate popular snare drum patterns. Some of
					the more well–known books include: <i>A New, Useful and Complete System of Drum Beating</i> (Charles
					Stewart Ashworth, 1812); <i>The Drummer and Fifers Guide</i> (George B. Bruce, 1865); and
					<i>Strube's Drum and Fife Instructor</i> (Gardiner Strube, 1870).
				</p>

				<p>
					If you look through these texts, you’ll find a lot of similar ideas, but with some variations with
					regards to naming and notation. In the early 1900s, thirteen American drummers got together to form
					<a href="		https://nard.us.com/History_of_N.A.R.D..html" target="_blank">NARD</a> (the National
					Association of Rudimental Drummers). These guys wanted to standardize the licks from the different
					books of the 1800s — to create a list of straightforward, common patterns that working drummers
					would need to know and be familiar with. In 1933 the first list of rudiments was born, with 26
					patterns. For some reason, NARD highlighted 13 of the 26 rudiments as being “essential”… whatever
					that’s supposed to mean.
				</p>

				<p>
					Then, in 1984, the Percussive Arts Society (PAS) decided to <a
						href="https://www.pas.org/resources/rudiments" target="_blank">publish a new list</a> with 14
					added rudiments. The five years effort was spearheaded by <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wanamaker" target="_blank">Jay Wanamaker</a>, who was
					joined by a “highly select group of percussionists” to create the list of 40 rudiments we know
					today.
				</p>

				<p>
					So the tl;dr is that the list of rudiments is arbitrary — what belongs on the list is ultimately the
					opinion of a few dozen or so drummers. Critically, the list only expresses what licks <i>these
						paticular drummers thought were common and important</i>. As I mentioned in the Reddit thread,
					patterns such as the “Single Stroke Five”, the “Nineteen Stroke Roll”, or the “Quadruple Stroke
					Roll” all abstractly exist as licks, but they’re not official rudiments.
				</p>

				<p>
					There’s an inherent problem with the 40 rudiments: they’re not objective or scientific. Rather, they
					reflect the specific perspectives and mindsets of a handful of drummers. The reason why something
					like the “Single Stroke Five” isn’t on the list is that the folks who cooked up the rudiments didn’t
					feel like such a pattern is popular or crucial enough to make the cut. To what extent that is
					correct is obviously debatable.
				</p>

				<p>
					As a drum set player, it’s actually a bit frustrating — the drum set barely existed when the first
					list was published (I’d say drumming as we know it today originated in the 40s). Even after the PAS
					updated the list in the 80s, the new list still doesn’t have the drum set in mind.
				</p>

				<p>
					After spending time with several rudiment books, the ugly truth I’ve discovered is that most
					rudiments do not work very well on the kit. I’ll concede that they all have some use insofar as they
					are challenging and technically demanding… but that wasn’t the original objective of the list. To
					that end, one has to wonder why <i>these</i> are the licks that are regarded as being good for
					conditioning. There are so many things to pratice out there, and the importance that many of the
					rudiments are given is unjustified. Meanwhile, for actually making music, most of them are crap, and
					their spots on the list would be better severed by other chops.
				</p>

				<p>
					The tradition of rudiments overall is pretty old–fashioned, or at the very least esoteric. The drum
					and fife practice of yesteryear doesn’t represent how most drummers approach the instrument
					nowadays. For instance, these days drummers often describe a drum roll as being “open”. That is to
					say, each note in the roll is in strict time with a well–defined subdivision (like a double stroke
					roll). This is contrasted with a “closed” roll or buzz roll, where it’s impossible to think of every
					note in the roll as being in time.
				</p>

				<p>
					However, at the top of the PAS list, there’s this weird spiel: “All rudiments should be practiced:
					open (slow) to closed (fast) to open (slow) and/or at an even moderate march tempo”. I have never
					heard a drummer used “closed” to describe something as being fast. I’ll provide another gripe:
					there’s really no need nowadays to write short rolls with numbers and slurs, as the list does. And
					why does the “Z” in the Multiple Bounce Roll look like it was written with Comic Sans?!
				</p>

				<p>
					Even players from the modern drum corps tradition are confounded by the rudiments list. Eric Carr (a
					tenor drummer with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Drum_and_Bugle_Corps"
						target="_blank">The Commandant’s Own</a>) made <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocbt6xjAGvo" target="_blank">a humorous video</a>
					tier–ranking all 40 rudiments, and he was quite blunt about how redundant and pointless many of them
					were.
				</p>

				<p>
					I whipped up my own ranking of the rudiments:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/drum-rudiments/drum-rudiments-ranking.png" class="centered-image"
					alt="Ranking">

				<p>
					Yeah, that’s pretty much how it works for me. Some are very useful. A few of them are... meh. The
					rest? Buttcheeks.
				</p>

				<p>
					At least, that’s how I would rank them <i>as they are written</i>. For instance, I never play the
					single stroke four or the single stroke seven as they are written; I always add an accent at the
					end. In this form, these two rudiments are closer to the oft–forgotten <a
						href="https://robinengelman.com/2014/06/26/a-ruff-death-1634-2008-requiescat-in-pace/"
						target="_blank">ruff</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					I really can’t help but think that drummers just worry too much about the rudiments. When new
					drummers get started out, they are often told to learn the rudiments, but I’m not a fan of that
					direction at all. Most new drummers are probably more interested in learning how to play a solid
					groove than they are in knowing what a triple ratamacue is and how to use it.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you really want to learn the rudiments, I always say get a rudiment book. I often sing the
					praises of <i>The Savage Rudimental Workshop</i> by Matt Savage. Once you get through it and learn
					all 40 rudiments, you’ll probably conclude that you can go the rest of your drum set career without
					touching most of them ever again.
				</p>

				<p>
					Rudiments are often compared to musical scales. I guess the thinking is that they’re both important
					because they’re foundational to creating music. But the core definition of a scale is pretty broad:
					a scale is just an ordered collection of notes. In addition, there’s no list of “official” scales;
					even something rather obscure like “Ultraphrygian” is still a real scale.
				</p>

				<p>
					A lot of drummers are generally unsure of what to make of the rudiments, other than a vague
					conclusion that the rudiments are important and you have to learn them. But that’s just not the
					case. To be clear, there are some very useful licks in there. And many more useless ones.
				</p>

				<p>
					I do admire the rudiments for at least trying to give names to different patterns. However, drummers
					still tend to be pretty bad at naming stuff, and generally can’t agree on what to call anything
					that’s not plastered with the label “rudiment”. Maybe not everything needs a name. But I think the
					philosophy helps more than it hurts. If a guitarist wants to tell the rest of the band to riff on
					Cm7 and Gm7, do you think everyone would prefer to <b>not</b> use chord names?
				</p>

				<p>
					Again, however, there’s no system to naming drum stuff the way we do with chords. And that’s really
					the way things are in drumland. Musicians need to agree on what keys and chords mean when they play
					together. Meanwhile, a drummer can play some 8th note groove, call it a
					“flam–a–eggbeater–cheese–a–diddle”, and no one will care as long as it grooves with the song. As
					Bonham once said, “It’s all very well doing a triple paradiddle — but who’s going to know you’ve
					done it?”.

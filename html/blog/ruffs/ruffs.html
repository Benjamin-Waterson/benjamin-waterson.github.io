            <p class="date"><i>Posted on July 3, 2022</i></p>
            <div class="full-row">

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-summary.jpeg" alt="Ruffs Summary" id="summary-image">
                <p>One of the biggest things I seem to complain about is how drummers can’t seem to agree on what to
                    call a lot of the stuff we play. Six Stroke Roll, Bonham Triplets, Metric Modulation… these terms
                    could mean several different things depending on who’s using them and what the context is.</p>

                <p>The worst casualty of this foible has to be the Ruff. Not many drummers in this day and age use the
                    term ruff, let alone know what exactly it’s supposed to mean.</p>

                <p>I first heard of the ruff in the context of a “four–stroke ruff”. The four–stroke ruff and its
                    related licks (e.g. three–stroke ruff, five–stroke ruff, and seven–stroke ruff) are basically short
                    rolls, played as singles, typically ending with an accented note:</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-four-stroke.png" class="centered-image" alt="Ruffs">

                <p>Seems simple enough, but I think I’ve seen as many as four other definitions. For some, a ruff is the
                    same as a drag. For others, a ruff is a closed drag. A ruff may also refer to any grace note figure,
                    or sometimes just grace note figures longer than two notes (i.e. longer than a drag).</p>

                <p>It’s also worth pointing out that, while ruffs are not on the PAS list of 40, the four–stroke ruff is
                    comparable to the Single Stroke Four off of the list. But the Single Stroke Four does not have any
                    accents, which makes me regard it as a different lick altogether (I guess “accented single stroke
                    four” could be a thing). In drum corps parlance, short single stroke rolls are typically called
                    “single 3”, “single 4”. etc.</p>

                <p>So where should we even start? Well, since there’s enduring confusion regarding the distinction
                    between the ruff and the drag, let’s start with the history of these words. It seems like ruff is
                    the older term, first showing up in <i>Warlike Directions</i> by Thomas Fisher. Published in 1643,
                    this is
                    one of the oldest books I know of that gets into any specifics of drumming.</p>

                <p>I use that term very loosely because the closest we get to actual notation is this:</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-warlike-directions.jpg" class="centered-image"
                    alt="Warlike Directions">

                <p>Having read the surrounding text, I’ve deciphered the “notation” of what’s supposed to be a march:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="serif">|</span> = right hand stroke</li>
                    <li><span class="serif">I</span> = left hand stroke </li>
                    <li><span class="serif">r</span> = “full ruffe” (note the spelling) </li>
                    <li><span class="serif">2</span> = “half ruffe”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The only problem is that the book provides zero explanation as to what a ruffe even is. Considering
                    that the book is describing some sort of march, it’s reasonable to conclude that a ruffe is a short
                    roll. Again, no explanation is given as to how you’re supposed to play it.</p>

                <p>Some more concrete details are provided in a document that drum historians call the <i>Douce
                        Manuscript</i>.
                    It’s basically a piece of paper that was found glued to the inside cover of a music book owned by
                    museum curator Francis Douce. The paper (believed to written sometime in the mid to late 1600s and
                    titled “The Grounds of beating ye drum”) has a line that reads something to the effect of “four
                    stroaks beginning easy and ending hard (I) am half Ruffe”. The manuscript also mentions a “Whole
                    Ruffe”, made up of five strokes.</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-douce-manuscript.jpeg" class="centered-image" alt="Douce MS">

                <p>It’s anyone’s guess as to what this all actually means, but this is (ostensibly) the earliest written
                    instance that specifically connects the ruff to a short number of strokes. It also mentions the
                    particulars of ending the ruff with an accent.</p>

                <p>Since ruff shows up in the mid–1600s, I was curious to find out when the term drag first appears. I
                    used Google Books to search for the oldest use of the word drag (or dragg) in a drumming context,
                    and I found an interesting answer: <i>Regulations for the Prussian Cavalry</i>, published 1757.</p>

                <p>Because <i>Regulations for the Prussian Cavalry</i> was originally written in German, it makes me
                    wonder
                    where the word “drag” originally comes from. Is it German in origin, or were the Germans just the
                    first ones to write it down? We may never know.</p>

                <p>The book doesn’t have any specifics on how to play the drag, which is pretty typical for books in
                    this period. Printing text with sheet music must’ve been a real pain back in the day, so these books
                    just tell you what the different licks are supposed to mean in a military situation (e.g. drill
                    commands) rather than how you’d actually play them.</p>

                <p>The first instance of a drag actually notated apparently comes from <i>The Young Drummer’s
                        Assistant</i>,
                    published in 1785 (note the spelling “dragg”):</p>

                    alt="Young Drummer’s Assistant">

                <p>I couldn’t find any notation of a ruff before this year. The oldest book I know of that has a ruff
                    notated out is <i>Benjamin’s Clarks Drum Book</i> — look in the bottom right corner and you’ll see
                    what
                    look like early versions of the Single Stroke Four labeled “ruffs”:</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-benjamin-clark.webp" class="centered-image" alt="Clark">

                <p>In addition, this is probably the first
                    book to have the single drag and the double drag notated, predecessors to the modern Single Drag Tap and Double Drag Tap, respectively.</p>

                <p>There’s another book called <i>The Revolutionary War Drummer’s Book</i> that apparently has ruffs,
                    described
                    as “1, 2, 3, 4 quick from hand–to–hand”. I couldn’t find a copy of the book to know for myself, and
                    I’m not sure when it was written — sometime in the late 1700s to early 1800s I guess. Interestingly,
                    the book calls the modern drag a 3 stroke roll. I think several other books from this timeframe do
                    the same.</p>

                <p>Drags became increasingly common moving into the 1800s. Charles Ashworth’s <i>
                        A New, Useful, and
                        Complete System of Drum Beating
                    </i> presents four drag licks to the world:</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-ashworth.jpeg" class="centered-image" alt="Ashworth">

                <p>Note the antiquated “half drag” and “full drag”. The full drag looks very much like the single
                    drag and (by extention) the modern Single Drag Tap. It’s still possible in this day and age to hear alternating
                    dragged quarter notes called half drags.</p>

                <p>Also note “Slow, Say 123” and “Quick Like a Drag”, both of which are comparable to the three–stroke
                    ruff (ICYWW, the slashes through the stems are accents). Meanwhile, the word “ruff” does not appear
                    in the book at all.</p>

                <p>In the early 1800s. David Hazeltine’s <i>Instructor in Martial Music</i> reportedly features three
                    and
                    four–stroke “roughs” as well as the single and double drags. I couldn’t find a copy of this one to
                    know how they are notated. I have the same problem with the <i>
                        Massachusetts Collection of Martial
                        Musick
                    </i>. Published around the same time, this book includes a rough, a single drag, and a double
                    drag.</p>

                <p>The reason I find this significant is because several rudimental manuals from the 1800s onward
                    include those three licks, written very similarly but with little in the way of explaining how they
                    are different. Take the original NARD list of 26 rudiments:</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-nard.png" class="centered-image" alt="NARD 26">

                <p>It seems like these three licks should be called “The Ruff”, “the Single Ruff”, and “The Double
                    Ruff”. Either that or just use “drag” for all three like the list of 40 does. Why use both? (This
                    isn’t even mentioning how the list of 26 uses “Drag Paradiddle” and not “Ruff Paradiddle”.)</p>

                <p>Well, in Elias Howe’s <i>United States Regulation Drum and Fife Instructor </i>(1861), these three
                    licks are
                    presented with similar notation, each in opened and closed styles (i.e. with strict, discrete
                    subdivisions, and as buzzed strokes). The book notes that “it is very difficult and almost
                    impossible to express or designate the Single Drag or Double Drag, when closed.”</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-howe1.png" class="centered-image" alt="Howe 1">
                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-howe2.png" class="centered-image" alt="Howe 2">

                <p>This is the first instance I could find of ruffs and drags both notated with grace notes, and it
                    seems to have kicked off the convention of playing ruffs as either being open or closed, while
                    always playing drags as open. Eventually, this evolved into treating ruffs as closed grace note
                    figures and drags as open grace notes figures. See how drag and ruff are used in Safranek’s <i>
                        Complete
                        Instructive Manual for the Bugle, Trumpet, and Drum
                    </i>, 1917:</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-safranek.png" class="centered-image" alt="Sanfranek" style="max-width: 500px;">

                <p>In 1861, <i>The Army Drum and Fife Book</i> (Keach, Burditt, and Cassidy) notates ruffs with 32nd
                    notes and
                    a trill marking, the latter of which has historically been used to specify buzzed strokes:</p>

                    alt="Keach, Burditt, and Cassidy">

                <p>George Bruce does something related in 1865’s <i>The Drummer and Fifer’s Guide</i>, while confusingly
                    instructing to “give every tap its distinct sound”:</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-bruce.jpeg" class="centered-image" alt="Bruce" style="max-width: 500px;">

                <p>Throughout the 1800s, it was still common to see ruff used to describe a short single stroke roll, as
                    in 1853 George Klinhanse’s <i>The Manual of Instruction for Drummers</i> (1853) and William Nevins’
                    <i>
                        Army
                        Regulations for Drum, Fife, and Bugle
                    </i> (1864):</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-klinhanse.jpeg" class="centered-image" alt="Klinehanse">
                <br>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-nevins.png" class="centered-image" alt="Nevins">

                <p>Notice the “Slow Say 123” in Klinehanse (à la Ashworth), and the “Slow Sag” in Nevins.</p>

                <p>In Howe’s aforementioned book, he lists a three–stroke ruff (with triplets) as an “Old Style Ruff”,
                    suggesting that, at some point in the 1800s, ruff had its definition changed from using singles to a
                    double and a single (i.e. LLR). Likewise for Bruce, who presents a three–stroke ruff starting on an
                    accent as a “Tap Ruff”. The book states that it’s “seldom used”, again suggesting some shift away
                    from single stroke ruffs towards LLR/RRL ruffs.</p>

                <p>Near the end of the century, the confusion become commonplace; Gardiner <i>

                    differentiating them:</p>

                <p>Of course, there’re more components to this dilemma. For one, think about what would you call these:

                <p>Many players in the 21st century would call them ruffs. That would make sense if they were played as
                    singles (indeed, single stroke ruffs can and often are notated with grace notes). But many drummers
                    would call these ruffs regardless of how they’re played, to help differentiate these phrases from
                    flams and drags. One grace note gives us the flam (technically a special grace note called an
                    acciaccatura), two grace notes will give us a drag, so what about three or more grace notes?</p>

                <p>I think people want to use ruff in this context, but I feel uneasy about it. What makes a drag a drag
                    isn’t how it’s necessarily written, but how it’s played. Consider this example:</p>

                    <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-tremolo-drags.png" class="centered-image" alt="Tremolo Drags">

                <p>If you were to observe the tempo marking, both measures would basically be indistinguishable. I would
                    consider both of them to have drags. As such, I think a ruff should be a ruff based on how it’s
                    played, not how it’s written.</p>

                <p>We don’t actually have names for specific grace note patterns. Case in point: a drag to a concert
                    snare drummer would most likely be played buzzed, compared to the open drag of a drum corps player.
                    Both drags could be notated that same — there’s nothing explicitly informing the drummer how to play
                    them, it just depends on the context.</p>

                <p>Also, think about what would you call these:</p>

                <img src="../../../images/blog/ruffs/ruffs-odd-grace-notes.png" class="centered-image"
                    alt="Odd Grace Notes">


                <p>They’re not exactly commonplace, but I have seen them. Are they ruffs? Drags? Neither?</p>

                <p>Adding to the confusion is the fact that these longer grace note licks are much more likely to be
                    found in the orchestra/concert band world than anywhere else, where they are also likely to be
                    played closed. And if you follow the “ruff = closed” paradigm, you could reasonably consider them to
                    be ruffs of different lengths.</p>

                <p>There’s one more wrench to throw in. It’s called the ruffle:</p>

                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omWvrFT0qWk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>

                <p>As you can tell, it seems to be built with three stroke ruffs. There’s a good chance the ruffle and
                    the single stroke ruff are related somehow, but I can’t say for sure. All this does is add to the
                    list of licks that are easy to confuse with one another. Wiktionary posits that the word ruff came
                    from ruffle, suggesting that this whole thing starts with the ruffle.</p>

                <p>So then… what <i>is</i> a ruff? My best understanding of the original definition is a short roll, but even
                    that requires some extrapolation, and forget about details regarding how you’d play it. I don’t know
                    exactly how, when, or why the ruff was turned into a grace note thing to be synonymous with drag.
                    Maybe at some point, people thought that the single stroke ruff became obsolete, but the word was
                    common enough to be valuable for repurposing. Nonetheless, that doesn’t really explain how we wound
                    up with texts that use “ruff” for some grace note licks and “drag” for others.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.historicdrumming.com/british-american-drumming/duty-call-the-march/ruffe/" target="_blank">This article</a> goes into considerable detail picking apart old drum texts, including the Douce
                    Manuscript, and postulates that the “whole ruffe” or “full ruffe” is the precursor to the modern–day
                    five–stroke roll, while the four–stroke “half ruffe” should be played as a “Stroke and a Drag”,
                    perhaps as something like RLLR, akin to the modern Single Drag Tap or the historic single drag. It’s
                    possible that, throughout history, “whole ruffe/full ruffe” was replaced by the five–stroke roll,
                    while the “half ruffe” was truncated down to just “ruff” with two possible interpretations thanks to
                    the ambiguity of these older texts.</p>

                <p>We’re getting into “Wild Mass Guessing” territory now, but if older drummers interpreted the ruff to
                    be built with singles, then they would need a term to refer to the other interpretation. Enter the
                    drag, a word that was either cooked up out of thin air or lifted from another tradition/language.
                </p>

                <p>Here’s the more important question: what should we use in this day and age? The contemporary
                    definition that I find to be the most useful (while still being related to the original) would be a
                    short single stroke roll, probably ending in an accent. Anyone who uses this is properly justified
                    in declaring themselves to be correct thanks to the earliest known instance of a notated ruff.</p>

                <p>There’s a historical basis for ruff and drag being synonyms, but we ought to pick one or the other
                    since using both only causes confusion nowadays. Drag is much more ubiquitous in the 21st century
                    thanks to the list of 40, so let’s stick with it. Ditto for “ruff = closed drag”. It’s obviously
                    commonplace to use open and closed to refer to the difference (thankfully, most drummers ignore that
                    dumb sentence on the list of 40 declaring open and closed to mean slow and fast, respectively). It
                    may be helpful in certain situations to use ruff to refer to longer grace note phrases, but as I
                    said earlier, I think this falls apart if you really think about it. That being said… most people
                    don’t.</p>

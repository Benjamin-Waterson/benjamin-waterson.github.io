		<h1><i>Whiplash</i> review</h1>
		<div class="full-row">
		<p class="top-paragraph">
			I'm not actually going to formally share this on the blog because I'm not sure that would be productive. I originally wrote this in the spring of 2015, shortly after I had seen <i>Whiplash</i> for the first time. Sometimes I write reviews for fun, but for this flick I just had to put my shock and horror into words. Criticising <i>Whiplash</i> is like farting in a windstorm — I doubt this will change anyone's mind, but in case you're wondering what my thoughts on this film are, here you go.
		</p>
		<p class="centered-text">	
			⁂
		</p>
		<p>
			I remember being younger and looking up Rotten Tomato scores for beloved films like <i>Up</i>, <i>The Dark Knight</i>, <i>Spirited Away</i>, and thinking to myself, <i>what’s up with the 5 or so people who don’t like these movies? What’s their problem?</i> Eventually you just have to accept that, no matter how much you enjoy something, there’s always going to those people who just don’t get it. Well, I have a much better time understanding those people now that’ve I watched <i>Whiplash</i>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			It was <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/01/sundance-winner-whiplash" target="_blank">the big hit</a> at Sundance this past year: a musical-drama written and directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Chazelle" target="_blank">Damien Chazelle</a>, staring Miles Teller as a jazz drummer and J.K. Simmons as the leader of a prestigious jazz band. <i>Whiplash</i> recently got its wide release in the United States and the crowd <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/whiplash_2014" target="_blank">has gone wild</a>. Every bit of praise imaginable has been dolled out to <i>Whiplash</i>: powerfully acted, incredibly intense, and authentic to its subject matter. Being a drummer myself, tons of people told me I just <b>had</b> to see this film. Life changing. A phenomenon. God, just insanely great.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			The story that <i>Whiplash</i> sets out to portray is a familiar one about a hard-driving teacher, a determined student, and the tough-minded sacrifices necessary for professional success. But what we end up getting instead is a bizarre piece of fiction in which both emotional and physical suffering appear to be their own reward. It’s silly, ridiculous, and totally unreasonable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Teller’s character, Andrew Neiman, is an ambitious jazz drummer at the fictional Shaffer Music Conservatory in New York City. Andrew has high hopes of becoming “one of the greats” (à la Buddy Rich), and shortly into the film he gets recruited into the school’s top jazz ensemble, led by Terrance Fletcher (Simmons). Once Andrew joins on, Fletcher’s teaching style quickly become clear as we watch him relentlessly abuse, torment, and attack his students to bring them to their top level. Andrew is no exception, and Fletcher becomes particularly obsessed with the 19 year-old drummer in his rampage for excellence. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Chazelle claims that he <a href="https://film.avclub.com/whiplash-maestro-damien-chazelle-on-drumming-directing-1798273033" target="_blank">used to be a drummer</a> himself before he set his mind to movie-making. If that’s the case, he has a lot of explaining to do; <i>Whiplash</i> makes me wonder if Chazelle has ever spent time with a musical ensemble. Now, we all know that a film’s inaccuracies won’t outright ruin it. But good lord, Chazelle doesn’t even seem to know how to correctly <a href="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/6.jpg?quality=90&strip=all" target="_blank">set up a drum kit</a>, let alone know how to portray functioning, college-level musicians with any degree of believability.
		</p> 

		<p>
			Worse still, <i>Whiplash</i> really wants to impress you with how much it thinks it understands music, with the script peppering in technical sounding words and phrases with no rhyme or reason. Combined with some slick editing and hip, modern-sounding jazz tunes, the film seems polished. But this feels less like authenticity and more like subterfuge, akin to a bad war movie that beats you over the head with stagy military jargon while giving no regard to what it all tells you about the story or characters.
		</p>

		<p>
			To further flex it’s musical knowledge, the movie has Fletcher frequently repeat and revel in a story about legendary jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker, who supposedly stepped up his game only after bombing a solo at a jam session, where a cymbal was thrown at his head by drummer Papa Jo Jones in response to the lackluster performance. In truth, Jones <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2014/10/whiplash-charlie-parker-and-the-cymbal-what-the-movie-gets-wrong-about-genius-work-and-the-10000-hours-myth.html" target="_blank">probably lobbed the cymbal</a> at Parker's feet, reacting more to the poor taste of Parker’s playing than the saxophonist choking under pressure. But who has time to research this stuff?
		</p>

		<p>
			The thing is, this isn’t <i>Whiplash's</i> biggest problem. Not even close. I could go on and on about how much the film misses the mark here, but I still understand that it’s entirely forgivable to stretch the truth in favor of drama. The most troubling issue at hand is that <i>Whiplash</i> makes me wonder if Chazelle has ever spent time understanding how to tell a good story.
		</p>

		<p>
			On top of having inscrutable character motivations, Andrew is just a brat; as only one example, he’s deeply embarrassed that his single father had to give up on becoming an author in favor of finding steady work as a schoolteacher. Andrew even lies to Fletcher about his dad’s job before fessing up that his pops is a just lowly high school educator. Am I supposed to care about this kid? You think with the gauntlet Andrew goes through, <i>Whiplash</i> would try to give us a reason to root for him… but no. I guess Chazelle figured that if you shower an actor with abuse, people will empathize with him even if you've done nothing to develop his character, or make him likable in any way.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then there’s Fletcher, an absolute birdbrain who commands no respect as a bandleader. The direction Fletcher brings to his ensemble is glib and superficial, yet that only scratches the surface of the song-and-dance behavior <i>Whiplash</i> tries to pass off for teaching. Fletcher takes every opportunity to turn a student’s mistake into an outrageous, time-wasting sideshow, often exploding into bloated and witless tirades that are more nonplussing than offending. Yet <i>Whiplash</i> has us believe that, somehow, not only is he taken seriously as an adult, but also that master players are churned out of his tutelage. One can only guess how this guy climbed up the education ladder.
		</p>

		<p>
			In terms of plot, save for from one or two mildly arresting parts, everything is as predictable as you’d expect. Andrew gets yelled at, mindlessly practices, spirals into his obsession, and then delivers a triumphant performance at the film’s finale. Yawn. All this muck dilutes whatever insight could be pried from <i>Whiplash</i>. On one hand, the film makes it seem like tireless practice and dedication will make you a legend at your craft, and all that’s needed to get there is having some dickhead scream at you.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, take a conversation between Fletcher and Andrew, where Fletcher justifies his cruelty by saying “the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged”. So now what? I guess being a great artist means having some sort of innate spark that’s less about musical insight and more about being able to put up with any amount of ridiculous, abusive nonsense, such as: being thrown out of an ensemble for doing nothing wrong, getting assaulted in front of your band, or having your director lie to you about when rehearsal starts (and yes, all three of those happen in <i>Whiplash</i>).
		</p>

		<p>
			Perhaps there are some redeeming parts to <i>Whiplash</i>. At least Simmons delivers his silly pontifications with conviction. And there is in an undeniable luster to much of the film that helps give it some allure. But like I said earlier, it just feels like a ruse. Is there really any appeal? Even the music scenes fail to be captivating. And why would they be? Is watching actors badly mime to a recording made by <a href="https://imgur.com/4XsfGZB" target="_blank">unknown studio players</a> supposed to be entertaining? And there’s barely any music even in the damn movie. Save for the final performance, <i>Whiplash</i> feels like it wants to move on from every tune as quick as it can. Perhaps the film is worried it’s going to bore us with that stuff. Well it should be — let’s just get back to the bloody drumsticks and hamfisted bleakness!
		</p>

		<p>
			I don’t blame you if you still want to watch <i>Whiplash</i>, since people are making it seem like you’ll miss out on a spiritual experience if you skip this film. And you know what, if you watched <i>Whiplash</i> and enjoyed it, fine. But I’m just not about it. I think I'm starting to understand what happens when a physicist watches <i>Interstellar</i>, or perhaps when an airline pilot watches <i>Flight</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			But both of those films try to give us an actual story with real emotions and characterizations, moving beyond their subject matter. Meanwhile, <i>Whiplash</i> spends most of its runtime just thinking highly of itself, further bogged down with its own gloom. I am reminded of a certian group of cartoon characters who <a href="https://southpark.cc.com/clips/154308/the-goth-kids" target="_blank">wallow</a> in their own hokey misery so they can spit out corny slabs of poetry to hold up as profound <a href="https://southpark.cc.com/clips/154316/goth-stan" target="_blank">pieces of art</a>, bragging about how they “get it” and you don’t. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Many poeple will tell me that <i>Whiplash</i> is not about drumming. Are you sure? Why does the movie have an infuriating insistence that it’s some sort of musical doyen? In any case, Chazelle doesn't seem to understand anything about how music works. If we want to think big picture and say it's a tale of artist obession, then why is <i>Whiplash</i> such balls? Even the best parts are derivative of <i>Black Swan</i>, but with none of the surreal, phantasmagorical moments that make <i>Black Swan</i> an interesting film.
		</p>

		<p>
			What should be the well-appreciated, finer discussion of topics like education, sacrifice, inspiration, and accomplishment gets stripped away in favor of tedious spectacle. If it’s not Fletcher’s ranting and raving, it’s a drum getting hurled across a rehearsal room, because *jazz*. All it does for me is make me wonder how anyone has time for something this pretentious, scatterbrained, shallow, and above all just plain clueless. 
		</p> 

		<p>
			For one final example, Andrew’s “triumphant” final performance features a drum solo that seems to be heavily based off of two Buddy Rich solos, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y31FDGQ_2gM" target="_blank">Concert for Americas</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otKKwKem570" target="_blank">West Side Story</a> performances. Yet before he even meets Fletcher, the film lets us know that Andrew likes to steal licks from Buddy Rich to use in his own playing. Since that’s all he winds up doing by the end of the movie, what did Andrew even learn from Fletcher? How to take a concert and shoehorn in completely unnecessary, unmusical drum solos? Does being “one of the greats” mean being a really good copycat? Was it all just a big waste of time? It sure feels that way…

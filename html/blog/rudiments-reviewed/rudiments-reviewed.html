                <p>Despite how often I maintain that the rudiments really aren’t important, they sure do live in my head
                    rent–free. I guess as long as other drummers insist upon some tenuous importance of these things,
                    I’m going to opine on them. Are there more important things to write about? Probably, but Todd
                    Bishop wrote <a href="http://www.cruiseshipdrummer.com/2020/04/40-international-drum-rudiments-frank.html" target="_blank">an article</a> like this, and EMC Productions did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocbt6xjAGvo" target="_blank">tier ranking</a>, so… here we are.</p>

                <p>I’ve presented the rudiments as they appear on the list of 40, and I’m evaluating them from the
                    perspective of a drum set player (that is, what’s good for creating licks, grooves, and fills).
                    Let’s get started.</p>

                <h4>№ 1: Single Stroke Roll</h4>
                
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-single-stroke-roll.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>The most basic and essential of all drumming motions. Pretty much every percussion instrument makes
                    use of singles, although on the concert snare drum it’s somewhat overshadowed by the buzz roll. Fast
                    singles aren’t a conceptually interesting thing, and many drummers deride them… but it’s an
                    important skill to me.</p>

                <h4>№ 2 & 3: Single Stroke Four, Single Stroke Seven</h4>
                
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-single-stroke-four-seven.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>We’re in the weeds now. I really don’t when these things were made (they aren’t on the list of 26),
                    and I also don’t know why. There’s something very contrived about them; many drummers would
                    recognize these as a “four stroke ruff”, “seven stroke ruff”, etc. I already wrote a whole post
                    about that debacle, and these two licks on the list of 40 are very different from the ruff of
                    yesteryear. With no accents or any sense of ornamentation, I don’t know what the point of these two
                    licks is and how they were developed. They are just rhythms more than anything else, and I never
                    play them as written. Nobody really does.</p>

                <p>Many have also wondered why there’re only two of these. There’s some precedent for several others.
                    Why no three? What about five and nine? I don’t get it.</p>

                <h4>№ 4: Multiple Bounce Roll</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-multiple-bounce-roll.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 50px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Another essential motion. Well… kind of. The sound of the concert snare drum is the sound of the buzz
                    roll, but it’s becoming an increasingly niche thing for other percussion disciplines. This topic
                    probably deserves its own post, since the buzz roll doesn’t really have a place in modern drumming.
                    In the 21st century, I rarely see it used in drums corps or on the drum set. That’s not that
                    surprising, since these players don’t really have to worry about playing unmetered strokes, which is
                    how the buzz roll works. I can think of many modern drumming heroes that have never played a buzz
                    roll on an album.</p>

                <h4>№ 5: Triple Stroke Roll</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-triple-stroke-roll.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Straight up, this is the dumbest rudiment. It’s very obviously a drum crops thing which looks cool,
                    and that’s really the only situation I see it used. I could never imagine a serious kit player using
                    this, let alone a tympani player or the like.</p>

                <p>There is some utility in playing repeated triple strokes off of one hand, but you’re better off just
                    practicing the classic double beat/triple beat drill instead of hand–to–hand triplets, which is
                    literally a waste of time.</p>

                <h4>№ 6: Double Stroke Open Roll</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-double-stroke-open-roll.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Another essential. Not as much versatility as singles, but more so than buzz strokes. If the sound of
                    the concert snare drum is the buzz roll, then the sound of a drumline is a double stroke roll.</p>

                <p>There aren’t many situations for a drum set player to use a long double stroke roll, but learning
                    that skill still goes a long way for short rolls and drags.</p>

                <h4>№ 7: Five Stroke Roll</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-five-stroke-roll.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>As written, these don’t go a long way. You could end a phrase with two of them, playing the roll on
                    the snare and the accent on a cymbal or something, which could be effective. It’s also a good lick
                    to have in your pocket if you ever need to accent 8th note off beats as part of a figure.</p>

                <p>The more popular interpretation is to use triplets, but you have to use them sparingly unless the
                    tempo is really cooking. It’s always worth mentioning the tap roll, where you basically play the
                    roll backward, starting with the accent. That could be a good way to embellish big quarter note
                    hits.</p>

                <h4>№ 8: Six Stroke Roll</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-six-stroke-roll.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Here we come to the world’s most misunderstood rudiment. It’s very rare to hear a drummer play this
                    as written (or anything close to it). It’s much more common to play all of the strokes as even notes
                    (typically with triplets), which is good fun… but it’s not a six stroke roll.</p>

                <p>I actually think playing these as written is an underrated lick: it’s another fun way to emphasize
                    big quarter note hits, and it works much better at slower tempos than the five stroke roll.</p>

                <h4>№ 9: Seven Stroke Roll</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-seven-stroke-roll.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>As written, the accent is in kind of a weird spot; it could sound good but only in very specific
                    situations. The tap variation seems much more common, again to emphasize quarter notes.</p>

                <p>There’s the somewhat antiquated triplet variation, which I call a NARD seven stroke roll, since it’s
                    all over the place in old NARD snare solos, going into a beat. Throwing one of these in a run of
                    triplets could be a fun changeup.</p>

                <h4>№ 10–14: Nine Stroke Roll, Ten Stroke Roll, Eleven Stroke Roll, Thirteen Stroke Roll, Fifteen Stroke
                    Roll</h4>
                    <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-rolls-9-15.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>I’m grouping these all together because they’re all kind of lame. These rolls can be fun to play on
                    your pad, but in terms of making music, they’re too long to have any cool syncopation. And yet,
                    they’re too short to build like a proper roll.</p>

                <p>I have heard them used effectively, but the examples are few and far between. Towards the end of the
                    big organ solo in “Squib Cakes”, David Garibaldi plays what’s basically a thirteen stroke roll
                    around the drums. I regard it as one of his best moments. You could also play two counts of triple
                    rolls ending with an accent, which would also be a thirteen stroke roll.</p>

                <h4>№ 15: Seventeen Stroke Roll</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-seventeen-stroke-roll.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Aside from the generic open roll, this is the closest the rolls come to sounding like proper drum
                    rolls. If you have a two–beat crescendo and the tempo works, playing one of these can be very
                    effective.</p>

                <h4>№ 16: Single Paradiddle</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-single-paradiddle.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>The holy grail of rudiments. We all love the paradiddle. It’s inherently useful as a way of playing
                    four–note patterns hand to hand, and orchestrating paradiddles around the kit will basically write
                    fills on its own. It’s also very easy to go in different directions with the paradiddle, just by
                    moving the accent around or by using one of the permutations (i.e. starting in a different spot of
                    the paradiddles).</p>

                <h4>№ 17: Double Paradiddle</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-double-paradiddle.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>The only time I play these as written is when I’m playing 16th note triplets and I need to start with
                    the right and end on the left. I just wrote about a solo lick using a two accent double paradiddle:
                    I reckon a two accented version is more useful overall. Permutations don’t seem to be very common in
                    the drumming world.</p>

                <p>There’s a well–known gag that involves playing a double paradiddle between the cymbal and snare to
                    create a pretty dull Afro–Cuban 6/8 groove. I don’t really do this because it creates a pretty dull
                    Afro–Cuban 6/8 groove.</p>

                <h4>№ 18: Triple Paradiddle</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-triple-paradiddle.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>I don’t get these. The triple paradiddle doesn’t even feel like a lick. It seems like a single
                    paradiddle with no accents that has four singles in front of it.</p>

                <h4>№ 19: Paradiddle–diddle</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-flam-paradiddle-diddle.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>One of my favorites. These just have such a unique lope to them. Easy to play, especially very fast.
                    Permutations do exist (kind of) and can be very fun.</p>

                <h4>№ 20: Flam</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-flam.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 150px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Another one of the basic motions, and probably the least developed for the typical drummer. I don’t
                    really regard these as licks, but rather as articulations; a way of playing a note, much like an
                    accent. Speaking of that…</p>

                <h4>№ 21: Flam Accent</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-flam-accent.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Fun to play on a practice pad, but I don’t know what else to do with these. Another way to accentuate
                    quarter notes I guess. You could stick the flam at the end of the beat, which could be swinging, but
                    with the same limitations as the five stroke roll. At fast tempos, some drummers might have an
                    easier time playing the rhythm as a Swiss army triplet.</p>

                <h4>№ 22: Flam Tap</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-flam-tap.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Another lick that’s a lot of fun to chop around with on a practice pad, but not so much on the kit. I
                    guess if you’re playing some funky, articulated thing on the ride bell, you could end a phrase with
                    two beats of these split between the cymbal and snare. But you have to use them sparingly or else
                    you’ll sound like a robot.</p>

                <h4>№ 23: Flamacue</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-flamacue.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>There’s a very cool idea hiding in the flamacue: playing a flammed note followed immediately by an
                    accented note. That’s the heart of the flamacue to me. But as far as playing the rhythm as written
                    on the list of 40… remember what I said about sounding like a robot?</p>

                <h4>№ 24: Flam Paradiddle</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-flam-paradiddle.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>While the single paradiddle is invaluable, the flam paradiddle just drains all of the fun out of the
                    stock paradiddle.</p>

                <h4>№ 25: Single Flammed Mill</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-single-flammed-mill.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>These are nicer to play than the flam paradiddle, but they probably have the same utility as the flam
                    tap.</p>

                <h4>№ 26: Flam Paradiddle–diddle</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-flam-paradiddle-diddle.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 40%; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>The flam paradiddle-diddle makes me wish the stock paradiddle-diddle was never invented. This is an
                    incredibly clumsy lick to play, and it’s up there with the triple stroke roll in terms of
                    foolishness.</p>

                <p>Do you want to know something really weird? The flam paradiddle–diddle is much older than the stock
                    paradiddle–diddle. I guess paradiddle–diddles weren’t really a thing people played until the
                    mid–1900s, while the flammed variety goes back a few hundred years.</p>

                <h4>№ 27: Pataflafla</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-pataflafla.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Helpful for sambas, and not much else: unless you wanted to play these are triplets or something
                    whacky like that.</p>

                <h4>№ 28: Swiss Army Triplet</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-swiss-army-triplet.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>A great lick. I’m a big fan of sweeping with the double stroke: playing two notes, on one hand, split
                    between two different drums, e.g. a tom and the snare. The Swiss drag is also one of my favorite
                    licks (a Swiss triplet with a drag on the second note).</p>

                <h4>№ 29: Inverted Flam Tap</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-inverted-flam-tap.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>One of the hardest (if not the hardest) rudiments on the list of 40. I keep telling myself that
                    mastering the inverted flam tap is the key to developing gnarly Steve Gadd ghost note grooves… but I
                    haven’t gotten there yet. It’s actually kind of a dumb lick: the same rhythm and phrasing of normal
                    flam taps, but with a significantly more annoying sticking that’s just there to help you show off.
                </p>

                <h4>№ 30: Flam Drag</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-flam-drag.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Again, one of the hardest (if not the hardest) rudiments on the list of 40. Getting flam drags up to
                    snuff is an important benchmark for many drummers, but I don’t care for these. I’d rather use the
                    Swiss drag.</p>

                <p>Here’s something that irks me: why do flams come before drags? Flams are much harder, and the flam
                    drag introduces the drag before the actual list does, which doesn’t make sense to me.</p>

                <h4>№ 31: Drag</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-drag.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 150px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>The final fundamental movement of drumming, and much like the flam, I consider this an embellishment
                    more so than a lick.</p>

                <p>Because the list of 40 uses grace notes for most of the drag licks, it’s tough for a lot of drummers
                    to conceive of how to use the drag: many feel like their playing needs to have space for the grace
                    notes. I tend to mentally picture drags as tremolo slashes on notes that are in strict time. I wish
                    we had separate terms for these two drag variations… but we don’t. Once upon a time, “ruff” could
                    have been used for this, but those days are long gone.</p>

                <h4>№ 32: Single Drag Tap</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-single-drag-tap.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Another way of accenting 8th note offbeats. Pretty much everyone uses a triplet variation though,
                    turning the grace notes into a proper note with a tremolo slash. At this point, just see my comments
                    on the other triplet–based licks.</p>

                <h4>№ 33: Double Drag Tap</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-double-drag-tap.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>If any drummer has played these on the kit, it was probably on accident. You can’t really turn the
                    drags into proper notes unless you’re going for a weird quintuplet thing. At least that’s an idea.
                </p>

                <h4>№ 34: Lesson 25</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-lesson-25.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>Here we come to the 34th rudiment, with the dumbest name of the bunch. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkiGBFNlWCg" target="_blank">this video</a> if you want
                    to know why we call this thing the “Lesson 25”. Yet another way of accenting the 8th note offbeat.
                    It’s okay.</p>

                <h4>№ 35: Single Dragadiddle</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-single-dragadiddle.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>A crackpot version of the paradiddle. Playing this just sounds like you’re doing something wrong.</p>

                <h4>№ 36: Drag Paradiddle #1</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-drag-paradiddle-1.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 300px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>This is basically a double paradiddle with a drag in place of the second note. I don’t really
                    consider these very often, but there’s potential.</p>

                <h4>№ 37: Drag Paradiddle #2</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-drag-paradiddle-2.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 300px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>This is basically a triple paradiddle with a drag in place of the second note. I don’t really
                    consider these very often, because there’s no potential.</p>

                <h4>№ 38: Single Ratamacue</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-single-ratamacue.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 200px; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>A lot of drummers can’t stand ratamacues, but I don’t think they’re all that bad. It can be a fun way
                    to end a run of triplets, and my band has a tune that features this rhythm as a reoccurring motif,
                    which I play using the single ratamacue (I would link to the song, but it hasn’t been recorded yet
                    since my band hasn’t been doing much of anything lately aside from making me depressed).</p>

                <h4>№ 39 & 40: Double Ratamacue, Triple Ratamacue</h4>
                <img src="../../../images/blog/rudiments-reviewed/rudiments-reviewed-double-triple-ratamacues.webp" class="left-image" alt="Cowbell" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 2em;">

                <p>…Okay, I’ll admit, these don’t really need to exist.</p>

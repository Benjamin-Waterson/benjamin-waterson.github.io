				<p>I really have no business doing this… but there’s no denying that, even 13 years later, the first
					Animals as Leaders album still puts quite a spell on people, especially drummers. If you go to the
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfzWpp0hMc" target="_blank">music video</a> for the
					album’s standout track, “Cafo”, you’ll see tons of people gushing over the drumming.</p>

				<p>Well, here’s the thing: the drums are programmed. It’s actually pretty obvious. They don’t sound very
					good, the hats and ride cymbals are typically ignored in favor of crash/china cymbal barrages, and a
					lot of the licks don’t really make sense from a drummer’s perspective.</p>

				<p>I can’t be too hard on the LP; it was basically a two-man job between AAL frontman Tosin Abasi and
					producer Misha Mansoor, and I’m guessing there was little to no budget.</p>

				<p>The songwriting is still top–notch, and I’ll admit that there’s something fascinating about drum
					parts cooked up by guitarists.</p>

				<p>I started transcribing the drums ages ago (to understand the rhythmic structure more than anything
					else), but I never got around to finishing it, so it sat on my computer unfinished. I partly lost
					motivation because I was getting too caught up in note–for–note subtleties that really wouldn’t give
					me much to learn from. In addition, there’s <a
						href="../../../pdfs/blog/cafo/CAFO_ANIMALS_AS_LEADERS_DRUM_TRANSCRIPT_BY_TROY_WRIGHT.pdf"
						target="_blank">a transcription</a> by Troy Wright that’s been floating around the internet for
					some time. It’s kind of messy, but for most, it works fine.</p>

				<p>Earlier this year, someone shared <a
						href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/s7rdt0/that_part_from_cafo_animals_as_leaders/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
						target="_blank">an excerpt</a> of them drumming along to the track on r/drums, and I had a bit
					of fun breaking down the drums for other users. With a new AAL album coming out next week, I decided
					to finish this up. As I said, the tune is captivating nonetheless, and the project at least gave my
					ears a workout.</p>

				<p>I opened up the sheet music with the guitar sweep, mainly for giggles. The first measure is 8 beats
					long, but I doubt the sweep cue would actually help anyone keep track of the pulse.</p>

				<p>The first thing to discuss is the big ensemble figure that the full band plays, and the drum part
					here has confused many drummers for years. When I first heard “Cafo”, I thought this section had
					some sort of buzz roll sample being played underneath the big 8th note hits.</p>

				<p>But after giving it a closer listen, I’m pretty sure the drums are playing 16th note triplets,
					ghosted on the snare. I had to skimp out on the sheet music because stuffing a measure of 9/4 with
					16th note ghost notes looked horrible. The idea is easy enough: just play 16th note triplets between
					the 8th notes.</p>

				<p>Currently, the upper limit for me to play 16th note triplets comfortably is 150 BPM. This is at 155,
					so it is possible. FWIW, current AAL drummer Matt Gartska plays the triplets as singles, while
					previous AAL drummer Navene Koperwies used puh–duh–duhs (RLL).</p>

				<p>Afterward, we are (eventually) introduced to the main 9/4 groove that drives the song:</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/cafo/cafo-main-groove.png" class="centered-image" alt="Main Groove">

				<p>Note how the kick drum is played in unison with the snare backbeats. Also, note the seemingly random
					crashes on the “+” after 4 and on beat 8. I wonder if there was anything about the guitar riff that
					made Misha highlight those beats:</p>



				<p>Your guess is as good as mine.</p>

				<p>The next big section is perhaps the most infamous since it’s built around a pretty disorienting riff
					(which is mirrored by the kick drum). The idea behind it is actually pretty simple: it’s all 8th
					notes, but the secret is that the kick alternates between 8th notes that are right on the beat, and
					8ths that are on the 16th note off–beat:</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/cafo/cafo-offbeat-riff.png" class="centered-image" alt="Off–Beat Riff">

				<p>I’ve seen many interpretations of the time signature. The riff lasts 13 quarter notes, but the
					guitars don’t seem to suggest any clear downbeats within the phrase. Troy’s transcription uses
					alternating meters of 6/4 and 7/4, while some explanations make use of 15/16. Personally, I think
					the easiest way to count it is two bars of 4/4 and one bar of 5/4.</p>

				<p>The drums then move to ride, with a ghost note pattern on the snare. I have given this section
					several close listens, and my best guess is that the ghost notes are played in between the ride
					cymbal notes. The ghost notes aren’t very articulate, and I have no real drummer to reference. But
					when the kick moves to the offbeats, I can’t hear the ghost notes, so I’m guessing the ghosts are
					being drowned out by the kick.</p>

				<p>The backbeats follow a pattern of 4 quarter notes. If you tried to play the ghost notes as written,
					you’ll run into some challenging tap–accent–tap triple strokes on the snare:</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/cafo/cafo-ghost-notes.png" class="centered-image" alt="Ghost Notes">

				<p>Try them at your own risk.</p>

				<p>The next big section is mainly in 4/4 (with a 3/4 turnaround). There’s some more ghost note action
					during the climax of this movement, featuring another triple stroke on the snare (tap–tap–accent):
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/cafo/cafo-ghost-notes-2.png" class="centered-image" alt="Main Groove">

				<p>It’s more playable than you think (definitely more so than the ghost notes from the previous
					movement). There’s also a linear fill at the end of the phrase, and I tried my best to make out the
					toms. For a lot of MIDI drum sets, toms tend to be either very punchy or very boomy (MuseScore has
					this problem). The toms kind of smear together, but the kick drum is at least correct.</p>

				<p>Speaking of MIDI mysteries, there are a lot of cymbal sounds on this album. I think I can hear both a
					china cymbal and some sort of cymbal stack, especially in this section.</p>

				<p>There’s another reprieve of the 9/4 riff, before a section that’s in 7/4 (I think it’s 7/4 anyway —
					you could count it with bars or 4/4 and 2/4). It’s at this point we have the closest thing I could
					describe as a change in dynamics.</p>

				<p>Next up is the guitar solo, before a driving shuffle section that features a very busy kick drum
					part:</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/cafo/cafo-shuffle.png" class="centered-image" alt="Shuffle">

				<p>Again, notice the unison hits between the kick and snare. I must admit, the fill heard in the 3/4 bar
					is pretty bitchin’, although it’s spoiled somewhat by gratuitous cymbal hits. I think the exact
					cymbals change the second time through, but honestly, I don’t really care. The rhythms are the same.
				</p>

				<p>After some more 9/4 riffing, we get to the finale, which features this rather hilarious–looking drum
					solo:</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/cafo/cafo-drum-solo.png" class="centered-image" alt="Drum Solo">

				<p>I’m pretty sure that’s what the drums are doing. It sounds better than it looks on paper!</p>

				<p>Now that we are in a particularly salient era of <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_masters_controversy" target="_blank">artists
						re–recording albums</a>, many have clamored for AAL to redo the debut. It’s not just the drums;
					the production, in general, is lackluster. It might be an exciting project, but I do have some
					nostalgia for the original album as is. It’s a bit of a mess, but it’s an endearing one.</p>

				<p> It’s also tough to say how Matt would approach such a project — he seems to channel the energy of
					the original drums when playing these tunes live, so I don’t know how much interest he has in
					writing new drum parts. So maybe instead we should be excited for his own transcriptions of the
					drumming on the new record coming out this Friday.</p>

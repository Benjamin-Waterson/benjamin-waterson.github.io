		<h1>Groove: “I Never Could Get Enough” — Patrick Hallahan with My Morning Jacket</h1>

			I finally have a good opportunity to talk about one of my favorite contemporary bands, My Morning Jacket. I also finally have a opportunity to talk about something a bit more recent, as the the band released an album at the end of October. It’s… ok — there are some really good songs, and some others that just don’t work for me. But today, I want to look at the groove from the album closer, “I Could Never Get Enough”.
		</p>

		<p>		
			It looks pretty straightforward, but I’m a big fan of the tom hits at the end of each measure. Considering the ride cymbal keeps going, it’s pretty nimble stuff. It’s also a two bar groove, since there’s an extra tom hit every other measure. The groove really gets going around the 2:20 mark of the tune. 
		</p>

		<p>		
			I’ve seen MMJ drummer Patrick Hallahan use as many as four toms live, but I can’t find many photos of the band in the studio. It sounds like a 12″ tom — which would make the most sense, since Patrick uses two 12″ and 13″ rack toms instead of a more typical 10″ and 12″ setup. 
		</p>
		<p>	

			I think I’ll revisit this album again sometime soon, as I think it’s probably Patrick’s best work with the band. I the meantime, you might want to check out this cooking show that Patrick apparently started earlier this year.

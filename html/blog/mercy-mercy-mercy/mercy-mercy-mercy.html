			<h1>Transcription: “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” — Dave Weckl with The Buddy Rich Big Band</h1>
			<div class="full-row">

				<p>
					This week, Dave Weckl will bring us the penultimate entry for these Memorial Concert posts. I must say, these posts have sure kept me busy. I feared I bit off a little more than I could chew when I got to Vinnie’s post, but now the end is in sight. Thank goodness I had some anniversaries halfway through to keep me from getting burned out. 
				</p>

				<p>				
					With Dave, I’m in sort of the same spot with as I was with Vinnie; none of Dave's songs have drums solos written in. So, Dave starts his second chart, “Bugle Call Rag”, with a free‐form drum solo, just like what Vinnie did on “Ya Gotta Try”. And just like Vinnie, I decided not to look at the solo. Yeah, the first thing I’m doing after I wrap this concert up is share a rant about drum solos… 
				</p>

				<p>				
					Also, Dave’s playing on “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” is just something else. During the four bar drum intro you can really tell he’s trying to bring the house down:
				</p>

				</div>


				<p>				
					Sorry for the quality. There’s no “official” upload for this tune. The VHS rips actually sound the best — the DVD rips have the aforementioned clicks and pops that just ruin the whole thing. 
				</p>

				<p>				
					Dave isn’t often categorized as a groove drummer, but oh man does he play this chart with a lot of feel. Like I said, the intro shows he’s pulling no punches. Just check out this 16th note triplet joint he slips in:
				</p>

				<p>				
					I have only one word:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/mercy-mercy-mercy/mercy-mercy-mercy-bitchin.gif" class="centered-image" alt="Bitchin">

				<p>				
					I start the sheet music with the first ~32 bars of the chart, which provide a good look at the moves Dave uses throughout the tune, including some funky ride/bell action, and hi hat barks played with the left hand. Each chorus uses a two measure drum solo as a segue, such as this one that starts on the third bar:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/mercy-mercy-mercy/mercy-mercy-mercy-solo-1.png" class="centered-image" alt="Solo 1">

				<p>				
					Dave had a double pedal that night, but I think he saves it for the fast doubles that we hear throughout, such as this little ditty at 1:55 that closes the first “War Chant” section:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/mercy-mercy-mercy/mercy-mercy-mercy-war-chant.png" class="centered-image" alt="War Chant">

				<p>				
					Side note: why the hell is that passage in the chart? The original Cannonball Adderley version doesn’t have it; arranger Phil Wilson specifically added it for Buddy’s version. I’ve tried to track down the origins of this motif, but its provenience remains unclear. You recognize it — the Florida Sate “Tomahawk Chop” uses the same general melody. Apparently, that tradition started in the 1980’s when a drunken frat bro <a href="https://www.tomahawknation.com/2012/5/1/2991946/the-real-story-of-how-the-seminole-war-chant-was-started" target="_blank">tried to sing</a> the riff from the Marching Chief’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KeXddd-dGQ" target="_blank">“Massacre”</a> and the rest of the crowd joined in. How tasteful.
				</p>

				<p>				
					But where’d the marching band get it from? There’s a suspicion online that the musicians for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_West_shows#Buffalo_Bill's_Wild_West" target="_blank"><i>Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show</i></a> cooked it up as a generic Native American combat theme (circa late 1800's). I couldn't find any recordings or sheet music to confirm this. The earliest piece I could find that unmistakably features the chant is a ragtime joint from 1905 called <a href="https://youtu.be/o9auVDd_ECI?t=40" target="_blank">“Silver Heels: An Indian Intermezzo”</a>. I guess the theme became a pastiche (more kitsch that pastiche if you ask me), showing up in everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" target="">John Ford</a> films to <a href="https://www.news-gazette.com/sports/prep-sports/baseball/tom-kacich-war-chant-rooted-in-theme-song-of-s/article_362cbc84-4cff-555b-b277-a5f6a56d41c5.html" target="_blank">Captain Kangaroo</a>.
				</p>

				<p>				
					Quite a detour I just went on, especially since, after all that research, I still don’t know what Mr. Wilson was smoking when he decided to shove that riff into a bluesy jazz tune. 
				</p>

				<p>				
					Moving on, the next section I took a look at comes right before the tenor feature. It kicks off with another two bar solo before Dave fills with the band, featuring some beefy singles:
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/mercy-mercy-mercy/mercy-mercy-mercy-solo-2.png" class="centered-image" alt="Solo Fill In">

				<p>				
					They don’t look like much on paper, but these triplets sound absolutely monstrous. 
				</p>

				<p>				
					The final section is the last chorus, which opens with another two bar solo. I finish out the song, including the big swing ending. Dave’s playing is, well…
				</p>

				<img src="../../../images/blog/mercy-mercy-mercy/mercy-mercy-mercy-bitchin.gif" class="centered-image" alt="Bitchin">

				<p>				
					I backed off on the hi hat for this one. I think it’s for the best. There are a couple linear licks that feature the left foot pedal, and these are included. But other than that, I'm starting to think it’s fruitless. 
				</p>

				<p>
					BTW, Dave has 5 toms; four in a typical setup, and one off to his left, Keith Moon style. I'm not exactly sure how big the drum is — I dug around but coulnd't find any description of his setup in the late 80's. I have it notated as the lowest floor tom. I think it only shows up once. 
				</p>

				<p>				
					Well that’s all for now. Only one more of these posts to go, so stay tuned!

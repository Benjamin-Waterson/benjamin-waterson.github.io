			I don’t really have a schedule for doing reviews and I don’t want to burn through them, but I really enjoyed <a href="../blog/a-funky-primer/a-funky-primer.html">writing about</a> <i>A Funky Primer</i>, so let’s have another one. I said I would review these books more or less in the order I went through them, but after A Funky Primer I want to jump ahead a bit to another funk book called <i>Advanced Funk Studies</i>, written by Rick Lantham and published in 1980. I think this was the ~4th book I went through. <a href="../blog/advanced-funk-studies/advanced-funk-studies.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			So today I’m going to respond to a video published back in August of 2019: “TOP 20 DRUM INTROS OF ALL TIME”. The video was made by Rick Beato, a music YouTuber who spent most of his life as a producer, and now talks about engineering and theory.

			Alrighty, time for something a bit more interesting. I found this band about three years ago, when Apple Music recommended them to me. They had just released an album, and this track “Salt of the Earth” was chosen for a new music playlist. It caught my attention right away when it came on. While the band wasn’t familiar, I recognized the drummer Alex Rüdinger after I looked into the group. Alex has played music with a whole slew of bands, most of it being rather intense metal. Not usually my cup of tea, so I wasn’t very familiar with Alex’s playing at this point. <a href="../blog/salt-of-the-earth/salt-of-the-earth.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

Add to that a bunch of work I’m doing on this site to make it easier to read on mobile. Oh, and then there’s that whole business of somebody shooting up the grocery store I used to go to up until barely a year ago.

			Oh, Tommy Igoe… you probably have one of two opinions of him. For many, Igoe is the mastermind behind <i>Groove Essentials</i> and <i>Great Hands for a Lifetime</i>, which are adored pieces of eduction for many drummers. I’ve spent quite some time with both, and they’re no doubt ambitious and well done projects.

			Yeah, I should probably know better than to talk about “Hey Joe” in the 21st century. But there’s no denying that it’s an incredible song, despite the rather… <i>disturbing</i> lyrics.
		</p>

		<p>		
			There’s actually some interesting speculation online as to why Jimi decided to make his debut single a cover song about a man who murders his wife and tries to hightail it to Mexico. Discussions usually reference Jimi’s turbulent military service (e.g. being conscripted into the Army and basically kicked out of it) as possibly drawing him to a song about violence, betrayal, and freedom. I’ve even found comments about how the background vocals are meant to represent the ghost of Joe’s wife, haunting over him as he tries to cheat the gallows. <a href="../blog/hey-joe/hey-joe.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Corea was obviously a talented pianist, but he was one heck of a composer — much like Frank Zappa, musicians could come from all over and show off by navigating Corea’s complicated arrangements. He also had a deep relationship with many drumming heroes, like today’s subject Steve Gadd, or perhaps Dave Weckl; The Elektric Band helped to firmly establish Weckl as a fusion legend.

			I have to be weary of movies that are about drummers. One the one hand, you have something like <i>Drumline</i>, a flick that’s pretty silly but mostly watchable. Then you also have that other movie about the jazz drummer — the one I try (<a href="../blog/whiplash/whiplash.html">and fail</a>) to pretend doesn’t exist. However, <i>Sound of Metal</i> has a premise more intriguing than any of those other films. <a href="../blog/sound-of-metal/sound-of-metal.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			So it’s time to distill my thoughts from the <a href="../blog/tags/tagged-1989-buddy-rich-memorial-concert.html">Memorial Concert posts</a>. The first thing I want to talk about concerns drum solos, since I originally wanted to share a solo from each drummer. I had to can an audible partway through this project, when I realized that notating six solos was not gonna happen. <a href="../blog/drum-solos/drum-solos.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			At long last! It’s finally time to wrap up the Buddy Rich Memorial Concert posts. Louie Bellson takes us home with the tune “Wind Machine”, from the first half. I kind of went about these in a weird order — Steve Gadd and Gregg Bisonette were the first drummers I had worked on, so I ended up just alternating from the first and second halves. I guess it’s appropriate to call it a day with the oldest drummer who was there. <a href="../blog/wind-machine/wind-machine.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			When <i>The Incredibles 2</i> came out ~2 years ago, I gave the original a watch to get ready, and I totally forgot what a killer soundtrack the film has (courtesy of Michael Giacchino). It’s that reason alone that <i>The Incredibles</i> is probably my favorite Pixar film, although I doubt I fully appreciated the score when I was younger. As a fun piece of trivia, this was actually Giacchino’s first Pixar collaboration. And what an effort. <a href="../blog/the-incredits/the-incredits.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			A simple post for this week: I want to take a unique look at a classic drumming song, “Rosanna” by Toto, off of <i>Toto IV</i> with Jeff Porcaro on drums. If there’s one part of this song all drummers know about, it’s the shuffle, but that topic’s been done to death. Instead, I want to look at a severely underrated part of the drum performance, and that’s the fills.

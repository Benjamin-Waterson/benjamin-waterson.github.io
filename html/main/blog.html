			If you’re like me and you’ve ever made the mistake of watching <i>Whiplash</i>, you probably sent your palm through your forehead at <a href="https://youtu.be/xDAsABdkWSc?t=155" target="_blank">the bit</a> where Fletcher points to a metronome marking and tells Andrew to “count me a 215” before he starts going on about “I am to understand that you cannot read tempo?!”. He also calls Andrew a retard, because edgy movie is edgy. If only I knew that the film was just getting started… (more thoughts on that <a href="../blog/whiplash/whiplash.html" target="_blank">here</a>).

			I wanted to make a short post discussing my notation software of choice, MuseScore, since a somewhat <a href="https://musescore.org/en/3.6" target="_blank">significant update</a> just came out at the end of last week. The MuseScore team calls it an “engraving” release, adding some neat features such as default indenting on scores (which I previously always did with a spacer), in addition to a feature that will organize instruments on a conductor score (using templates such as “Orchestra” or “Jazz Band”). Perhaps most significantly, a new music font was added, “Leland”. <a href="../blog/musescore-3.6/musescore-3.6.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I have to be weary of movies that are about drummers. One the one hand, you have something like <i>Drumline</i>, a flick that’s pretty silly but mostly watchable. Then you also have that other movie about the jazz drummer — the one I try (<a href="../blog/whiplash/whiplash.html">and fail</a>) to pretend doesn’t exist.

			I’m analyzing a bit of a deep cut, from their oft-forgotten second album <i>Weightless</i> (2011). I wasn’t tuned into Animals as Leaders when it came out, and while I suspect it got the attention it deserves when it was first released, it seems to be overlooked now. <a href="../blog/odessa/odessa.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			This week, I’m sharing my interpretation of a drumming classic: “Aja” by Steely Dan, with Steve Gadd on drums. I couldn’t gush over this whole record enough, like many drummers and musicians have. But in all seriousness, <i>Aja</i> is one of the most important albums for me as a drummer, and Steve’s solo is one of those moments that totally changes the way you look at the instrument. <a href="../blog/aja/aja.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Coming at you this week with a full song transcription: “Little Wing” by Jimi Hendrix.

			I really got into Hendrix during the spring semester of my senior year in high school, and as I dove into Mitch’s playing, I poked around online for some drum sheet music. This was back when I assumed the average drummer on the internet knew what they were doing when it came to transcribing (or really when it came to anything). <a href="../blog/little-wing/little-wing.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Welcome to the blog! I have a lot of things to share on my site, and I’ll kick things off with sheet music for the classic “Good Times Bad Times”. Most of the really famous licks are pretty well known, but since it’s such a revered tune I took a detailed look. I don’t have a lot of full-length transcriptions, but with songs like this that are under 3 minutes, it’s not too difficult. <a href="../blog/good-times-bad-times/good-times-bad-times.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

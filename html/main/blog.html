		<p>I really have no business doing this… but there’s no denying that, even 13 years later, the first Animals as Leaders album still puts quite a spell on people, especially drummers. If you go to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfzWpp0hMc" target="_blank">music video</a> for the album’s standout track, “Cafo”, you’ll see tons of people gushing over the drumming.</p>

		<p>Well, here’s the thing: the drums are programmed. It’s actually pretty obvious. They don’t sound very good, the hats and ride cymbals are typically ignored in favor of crash/china cymbal barrages, and a lot of the licks don’t really make sense from a drummer’s perspective. <a href="../blog/cafo/cafo.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

		<p>As I wrote <a href="../blog/know-your-tempos-pink-floyd/know-your-tempos-pink-floyd.html" target="_blank">last week</a>, I’ve been listening to some Pink Floyd lately, as I often do at the start of the year. I regard Pink Floyd as one of the best bands out there, mainly because of their songwriting, vision, and ambition… but I’ve struggled to find a way to talk about them on the site. I don’t want to pick apart one of their tunes from a compositional perspective, since other (more knowledgable) people have <a href="https://youtu.be/K6HCykbHtBM" target="_blank">already done that </a>better than I could.

		<p>I’ve been perusing Pink Floyd’s discography as part of a more ambitious post for next week when I realized that I could kill two birds with one stone and whip up a “Know Your Tempos” post. Here’s my boilerplate explanation:</p>

		<p>		
			If you ever see some sheet music that says “♩ = 215” and you don’t have a metronome on you, all you need to do is sing a song that you know was recorded at 215. Voilà. You’ll have a pretty good idea of how fast you’re supposed to play.  It won’t be as accurate as using a click, but it’s a good trick to have… if you get a decent mental collection of these things, you’ll have a good reference for a variety of tempos. Or tempi. Whatever.

		<p>It’s been a tough week to stay focused. Hell, the news <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-orders-nuclear-deterrent-forces-high-alert-tensions-build-ukrain-rcna17853" target="_blank">this morning alone</a> was pretty exhausting. The carnage in Ukraine is bad enough, but this whole conflict has really broken the brains of a lot of people in the political circles I’m in.</p>

		<p>Maybe someone can clear this up for me, but I just have a difficult time getting behind invading a country that didn’t attack you or your allies. And don’t get it twisted, I’m no big fan of America’s foreign policy, but let’s put our grown–up pants on and realize two things can be wrong at the same time.</p>

		Drums Don’t Play Actual Pitches. And Even if They Could, Why Would You Want Them To?

		<img src="../../images/blog/drums-and-pitches/drums-and-pitches-summary.jpg" alt="Drums and Pitches Summary"  id="summary-image">	
		<p>I’m starting to wonder if drummers are on a misguided quest to try and get their instrument to be taken more seriously. I think the metric modulation nonsense that I often <a href="../blog/advanced-music-theory/advanced-music-theory.html" target="_blank">complain about</a> is part of this; other instruments get to talk about advanced harmony, so I get the appeal… but you just end up looking silly to non–drummers.</p>

		<p>There’s another topic I want to look at in the same vein: tuning drums to notes. Like many problems in this day and age, the internet is partly to blame. Case in point: my inspiration to write this comes from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/styzk9/rant_nothing_on_a_standard_drumset_is_a_pitched/" target="_blank">a Reddit thread</a> that was started this past week.

		<p>Without a doubt, this is the number one question asked in internet drumming circles. Anyone who asks how to get started on the drums is guaranteed to get at least a few responses, so I’ve never bothered chiming in. I always figured that full–time teachers would be best at responding since they have to routinely get beginners up to speed. But I do have some thoughts to share, and despite my desire to see different topics brought up online, the burden is ultimately on me to come up with stuff to talk about.

				I don’t give myself lot of opportunities to talk about music that’s hip and contemporary. For one, it takes time to evaluate whether or not a piece of music is really worth dissecting. I am also reminded of a scene from the TV show <i>Bosch</i> where the titular character has a conversation with his friend where his comrade says something to the extent of, “Why don't you listen to music from this century?”, to which Bosch replies, “Because I'm still getting caught up on the last one!”.

				Here’s a packet containing a handful of exercises that I’ve used over the years to build speed and stamina for some pretty simple sticking patterns, mainly singles, doubles, and basic rudiments (like the single paradiddle and the paradiddle–diddle). The kind of things you want to be able to play fast depends on what kind of a player you are, but in reality, it’s only the simple patterns that are worth practicing. There’s not really a need for the typical drummer to get good at playing inverted flam taps really fast. <a href="../blog/speed-exercises/speed-exercises.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Ever since I wrote about Charlie Watts and <i>Get Yer Ya–Ya’s Out!</i> <a href="../blog/charlie-watts-midnight-rambler/charlie-watts-midnight-rambler.html" target="_blank">last week</a>, I’ve been on a bit of a classic rock kick, especially with live albums. And so this week, I’m finally going to talk about <i>Live at Leeds</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			It’s hard to fully explain the impact this album has had on me as a drummer. Keith’s playing on this record is just out of this world. Keith is often regarded as a zany, fly–by–the–seat–of–his pants kind of player. But the closer attention I’ve paid to his drumming, the more I’ve appreciated his nuances, as well as how he navigated the arrangements with the rest of the band. <a href="../blog/amazing-journey/amazing-journey.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			When it comes to learning jazz, many drummers are often steered towards two very famous books: <i>Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer</i> by Jim Chapin, and <i>The Art of Bop Drumming</i> by Jim Chapin.

Since the start of this summer, there’s been <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/07/13/muse-group-continues-tone-deaf-handling-of-audacity/" target="_blank">a huge kerfuffle</a> involving the MuseGroup’s control of Audacity.

			Rolo Tomassi was recommended to me a few years ago, sometime after their album Time Will Die and Love Will Bury was released. The song Apple Music gave to me was “Aftermath”, and I really dig the tune. It’s got some rather ethereal verses and a very powerful ending. However, I soon discovered afterward that I had fallen victim to a bit of a bait and switch since most of the band’s catalog consists of some gnarly music with harsh vocals.

In the midst of that, I rediscovered +44’s one and only album, <i>When Your Heart Stops Beating</i>. +44 was cooked up by Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker after their previous band Blink-182 broke up for the first time. I don’t really remember this album getting released; I think the first time I heard it was around 2007–08.

			Like “How Many More Times”, this was a Zeppelin song that escaped me for a few years after I first got into the band.

			Now that it’s finally warming up, it’s time for some Jimi. I probably shouldn’t let the weather dictate my musical tastes, since (conceptually) music should be able to exist as an artistic statement on its own… but I just don’t feel like listening to Hendrix when it’s snowing outside. I first got into Hendrix in the springtime when things were warming up, although after looking into it, I discovered that two of the three Experience albums (including this one) were released in the winter/fall.

			I have a big list of drummers that I need to listen to more. In fact, for most of the drummers I know of, I have yet to fully explore and appreciate their discographies.

			Alrighty, time for something a bit more interesting. I found this band about three years ago, when Apple Music recommended them to me. They had just released an album, and this track “Salt of the Earth” was chosen for a new music playlist. It caught my attention right away when it came on. While the band wasn’t familiar, I recognized the drummer Alex Rüdinger after I looked into the group. Alex has played music with a whole slew of bands, most of it being rather intense metal. Not usually my cup of tea, so I wasn’t very familiar with Alex’s playing at this point. <a href="../blog/salt-of-the-earth/salt-of-the-earth.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Yeah, I should probably know better than to talk about “Hey Joe” in the 21st century. But there’s no denying that it’s an incredible song, despite the rather… <i>disturbing</i> lyrics.
		</p>

		<p>		
			There’s actually some interesting speculation online as to why Jimi decided to make his debut single a cover song about a man who murders his wife and tries to hightail it to Mexico. Discussions usually reference Jimi’s turbulent military service (e.g. being conscripted into the Army and basically kicked out of it) as possibly drawing him to a song about violence, betrayal, and freedom. I’ve even found comments about how the background vocals are meant to represent the ghost of Joe’s wife, haunting over him as he tries to cheat the gallows. <a href="../blog/hey-joe/hey-joe.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

I said in that post that there was a chance I would write about this in the future, and here we are. I have four topics to discuss: syncopation, polyrhythm, polymeter, and metric modulation. I want to share my understanding of what these terms mean, and I’ll try to address what seems to be the omnipresent confusion regarding them. <a href="../blog/advanced-music-theory/advanced-music-theory.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Corea was obviously a talented pianist, but he was one heck of a composer — much like Frank Zappa, musicians could come from all over and show off by navigating Corea’s complicated arrangements. He also had a deep relationship with many drumming heroes, like today’s subject Steve Gadd, or perhaps Dave Weckl; The Elektric Band helped to firmly establish Weckl as a fusion legend.

			What you’re hearing is a guy named Ryo Fukui (福居良). He began his life in music by playing the accordion (like all of us), and then at the age of 22 decided he wanted to be a jazz pianist. And after 6 years of self-taught instruction, he cut his first album, <i>Scenery</i>. <a href="../blog/early-summer/early-summer.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			A simple post for this week: I want to take a unique look at a classic drumming song, “Rosanna” by Toto, off of <i>Toto IV</i> with Jeff Porcaro on drums. If there’s one part of this song all drummers know about, it’s the shuffle, but that topic’s been done to death. Instead, I want to look at a severely underrated part of the drum performance, and that’s the fills.

		<p>
			Porcaro plays some awesome fills throughout the track, even if they are overshadowed by the main groove. <a href="../blog/rosanna/rosanna.html"><i>Read More ...</i></a>

			It’s finally time for some Keith Moon, the man who got me into drumming. I think <i>Live at Leeds</i> is one of the most important albums for any drummer to listen to, myself especially. I expect that one of these days I’ll take a look at the record; I’m even tempted to do a full note-for-note transcription of it…

			About four years ago, David Garibaldi released <a href="https://www.alfred.com/off-the-record/p/00-41239/" target="_blank">a collection of sheet music</a>, transcriptions he made himself to show off his playing with Tower of Power. I really like it when drummers take a look at their own playing, it’s the best look you’ll probably get at their work. I have the book myself, and it’s a great look at some very busy, dense/harmonic funk drumming. Garibaldi has some nutty drum parts. <a href="../blog/the-price/the-price.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			I’m analyzing a bit of a deep cut, from their oft-forgotten second album <i>Weightless</i> (2011). I wasn’t tuned into Animals as Leaders when it came out, and while I suspect it got the attention it deserves when it was first released, it seems to be overlooked now. <a href="../blog/odessa/odessa.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			This week, I’m sharing my interpretation of a drumming classic: “Aja” by Steely Dan, with Steve Gadd on drums. I couldn’t gush over this whole record enough, like many drummers and musicians have. But in all seriousness, <i>Aja</i> is one of the most important albums for me as a drummer, and Steve’s solo is one of those moments that totally changes the way you look at the instrument. <a href="../blog/aja/aja.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Coming at you this week with a full song transcription: “Little Wing” by Jimi Hendrix.
		</p>

		<p>
			I really got into Hendrix during the spring semester of my senior year in high school, and as I dove into Mitch’s playing, I poked around online for some drum sheet music. This was back when I assumed the average drummer on the internet knew what they were doing when it came to transcribing (or really when it came to anything). <a href="../blog/little-wing/little-wing.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>

			Welcome to the blog! I have a lot of things to share on my site, and I’ll kick things off with sheet music for the classic “Good Times Bad Times”. Most of the really famous licks are pretty well known, but since it’s such a revered tune I took a detailed look. I don’t have a lot of full-length transcriptions, but with songs like this that are under 3 minutes, it’s not too difficult. <a href="../blog/good-times-bad-times/good-times-bad-times.html"><i>Read More . . .</i></a>
